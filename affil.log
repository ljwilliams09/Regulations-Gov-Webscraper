INFO - Summary: Approving the Keystone XL pipeline and developing tar sands oil would undermine progress on clean energy and climate leadership and pose unacceptable environmental risks; I urge the administration to reject Keystone XL.
INFO - Affiliation: None
Canadian Tar Sands are dirty, and constructing the pipeline would benefit foreign interests rather than Americans, so I oppose it.
