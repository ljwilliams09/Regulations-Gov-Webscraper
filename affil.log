INFO - Comment: Dear U.S. Maritime Administration, <br/><br/>I’m deeply concerned about the environmental and economic risks that may be caused by the Blue Marlin oil-export project.   <br/><br/>Energy Transfer Partners, a U.S. energy company, wants to build and operate a massive crude oil export terminal in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Port Arthur, Texas, and Cameron Parish, Louisiana. If the project is approved and the facility is built, 2 million barrels of domestically produced crude oil will be loaded daily onto tankers (730 million barrels per year) and exported to European and Asian markets. When burned, the oil will exacerbate climate change and further damage sensitive ecosystems in Louisiana and Texas that are already overburdened by industrial activities. <br/><br/>To support this work, a new 42-inch-diameter crude oil pipeline would be constructed, running right through Sabine Lake and Bessie Heights Marsh — two of the most important habitats for fish and birds in the region. Running a pipeline there could hurt sensitive and imperiled species that live in nearby shoreline, estuary, and marine habitats, including piping plovers, alligator snapping turtles, monarch butterflies, West Indian manatees, manta rays, and Rice's whales. <br/><br/>Sabine Lake is a popular destination for fishermen, boaters, birdwatchers, and other tourists who visit annually, providing economic opportunity to businesses in the region. The lake is also home to highly sensitive oyster reefs that support the overall health of the estuary and shelter many fish species that draw in fishermen. <br/><br/>An oil spill in Bessie Heights Marsh or Sabine Lake would be a long-lasting disaster for wildlife, fisheries, and human communities. I’m particularly concerned about Energy Transfer Partners' track record, which includes a history of oil spills, contaminated drinking water, and safety violations. Between 2022 and 2017, Energy Transfer Partners and its subsidiaries were responsible for more than 500 spills of hazardous liquid that caused around $115 million in property damage. Energy Transfer Partners has also been fined more than $355 million since 2000 and reportedly amassed more than 800 state and federal permit violations while building its Rover and Marin pipelines. <br/><br/>Finally, if approved the Blue Marlin oil-export project could harm public health, the environment, and the climate through potential onshore and offshore oil spills, construction and operation for the terminal and pipeline, and lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from the project that will contribute to climate change. <br/><br/>I urge the Maritime Administration and the U.S. Coast Guard to conduct the searching analyses required under the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Deepwater Port Act to sufficiently evaluate the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the Blue Marlin oil-export project.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Gloria Shen<br/>NC 28805

INFO - Comment: I am glad to see that USDA has proposed a regulation to ensure that birds on exhibit or in the pet trade receive the protections of the Animal Welfare Act to which they have long been entitled.<br/><br/>Thank you for requiring environmental enrichment for all birds, which is needed to meet the welfare standards required under the law, and water access for aquatic birds; prohibiting the sale of unweaned birds; requiring licensing for entities with four or more breeding females; and including birds used in falconry under the proposed regulations. These are vital steps toward addressing the significant welfare issues that have gone unaddressed for so long.<br/><br/>There are shortcomings in the proposal, however, that left unaddressed would cause harm to birds, contrary to the purpose of the regulation. The regulation must do the following:<br/><br/>1. prohibit nontherapeutic physical alterations (including deflighting) and tethering for unlimited amounts of time;<br/><br/>2. require that long-term facilities provide areas for birds to fly, an essential behavior that is critical to good health for birds;<br/><br/>3. require the licensing of pet shops that sell birds, since birds have not been domesticated like dogs and cats; and<br/><br/>4. restrict public contact with birds.<br/><br/>It is clear that these protections are needed to remedy the abuse to which so many birds are subjected. Thank you for acting in the best interests of these animals.

INFO - Comment: I am disappointed by the recent rules regarding the reporting of digital asset transactions. While I understand the need for transparency and the pursuit of tax cheats, the inclusion of every single transaction, including those of average consumers, seems excessive. This requirement goes beyond the original intent of Congress and sets a concerning precedent.<br/><br/>The sheer volume of data that would need to be reported is staggering. It would far surpass the annual reported transactions of any major brokerage. This level of detail seems impractical and raises questions about the feasibility of enforcement.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the focus on pursuing bad actors and tax cheats using blockchain technology should not overshadow the potential benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry and empower individuals. Placing burdensome reporting requirements on everyday transactions could stifle innovation and hinder the growth of this promising sector.<br/><br/>I urge you to reconsider the scope of these rules and find a balance that promotes transparency without hindering the potential of DeFi. It is crucial to strike a balance that allows for innovation while still addressing legitimate concerns about tax evasion.

INFO - Comment: Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers. <br/><br/>The ATF’s proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized. <br/><br/>1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale—or no sale at all—might require a license:<br/><br/>ATF’s rule claims that the agency has opted not to "establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year" that require licensure, and instead suggests that "even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."<br/>However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who "regular[ly]" and "repetitive[ly]" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple "firearms." <br/><br/>2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:<br/><br/>Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted "occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby." According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be "engaged in the business" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF’s rule provides no such assurances.<br/><br/>3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:<br/><br/>Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer—private gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court’s Caniglia decision in 2021. <br/><br/>In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called "welfare check." But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police—and the Biden administration—with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.<br/><br/>4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:<br/><br/>One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have "willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license." Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior. <br/><br/>Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF’s footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don’t! <br/><br/>5. ATF’s backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration: <br/><br/>So-called "Universal Background Checks" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime. <br/><br/>The Biden Administration described this as "moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation." And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales. <br/><br/>But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.

Guns sold without background checks—both online and at gun shows—are a huge source for gun traffickers and people looking to avoid a background check. These guns often end up trafficked across state lines, recovered at crime scenes in major cities, and used against police officers. This contributes to the gun violence epidemic plaguing our country. The long-standing lack of clarity around which sellers must become licensed and run background checks has made this problem all the worse. <br/><br/>I support the clear common-sense standard laid out in this rule: Anyone offering guns for sale online or at a gun show is presumed to be trying to make a profit and should therefore be licensed and run a background check on their customers. This rule will save lives and should be urgently finalized.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Andrew Reilly

INFO - Comment: I currently work for Con-Way Central Express, a major LTL transportation company.  I would like to comment on the proposed new rules for Hours of Service for truck drivers.  Safety is something that I personally, and the company I work for pay close attention to.   I understand the importance of designing a rule for drivers that ensures that commercial truck drivers are well rested, which in turn will help make our highways safer.  However, in reviewing these rules, it is my belief that in fact they may compromise safety.   My company and the trucking industry as a whole has an excellent safety record.  In the decade from 1986 to 1996, the fatal accident rate for large trucks dropped 35%, while during the same period of time miles driven increased 40%.  In the five-year period from 1989- 1993, there was an average of 6.3 million traffic accidents annually. Of those accidents, the investigating police cited driver fatigue as a factor only 1.6% of the time. Of the approximately 100,000 fatigue- related accidents that occurred from 1989-1993, large trucks were involved in less than 4%.   I understand that the proposed rules would require a 50% increase in the number of trucks on our already crowded highways to keep the economy moving.  This would translate into an additional 180,000 trucks, elevating the risk for many more serious accidents.   Drivers already have difficulty finding adequate rest areas to pull over and sleep.  These rules will make it worse.  A 1996 study by the ATA and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) found a nationwide shortage of 28,000 public rest area parking spots for truck drivers. Though requiring more rest time for drivers, the Agency has not taken into account how and where the extra activity can take place, and certainly has not taken into consideration the possible 180,000 additional drivers on the highways.  While attempting to manage driver fatigue on the highway, the agency has ignored the fact that there are no plans to fund the development of additional rest areas. Failure to solve the truck parking shortage would also pose significant risks to the traveling public by forcing tired drivers to continue driving or park on inherently dangerous locations such as ramps and shoulders.   Lastly, these rules will have a negative economic impact on my company, as well as my fellow coworkers and myself.  The typical driver in our company will see an annual reduction of $11,537.50 in earnings, while our company will see an additional operating cost of $52,336,873 per year, further affecting the potential earnings of all employees.  Unfortunately, the additional operating costs will eventually relate to higher prices for consumers, therefore, increasing overall economic inflation.   The impact to myself, family, coworkers and company will be overwhelming.  As well, the impact to the American economy is likely to be huge.  In 1997, over 60% of our nation's primary goods moved by truck.  The proposed rules would force delivery systems that are structured for our new e-commerce economy back into old economies and efficiencies.  I appeal to you to take a close look at the proposed rules and compromise a resolution that gives the trucking industry, our economy, and highway safety the real reform it deserves.   Thank you. <br/>

INFO - Comment: The proposed rule is an illegal electric vehicle mandate.<br/><br/>The proposed rule follows directly from the Green New Deal page at JoeBiden.com's plan of "developing rigorous new fuel economy standards aimed at ensuring 100% of new sales for light- and medium-duty vehicles will be electrified" and Biden's Executive Order 14037 that sets "a goal that 50 percent of all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or fuel cell electric vehicles."<br/><br/>Implementing that goal is contrary to law.  Specifically, 49 U.S.C. § 32902(h)(1) prohibits you from considering the fuel economy of automobiles that operate only on alternative fuel.<br/><br/>Your proposed miles-per-gallon standards are twice the fuel economy of the most efficient gasoline-powered car, the Toyota Prius.  The only way to comply with your proposed fleetwide standard is to dramatically increase electric vehicle sales, and indeed the EPA -- with whom Biden directed you to coordinate via EO14037 -- expressly assumes that 30 percent of vehicle sales will be electric vehicles in model year 2027, rising to 67 percent by 2032.<br/><br/>Congress was right to ban electric vehicle mandates because Americans deserve the right to buy vehicles that suit their needs and preferences, and continued strong demand for internal combustion vehicles disproves your claims of consumer benefits.<br/><br/>The proposed rule is economically destructive as well as illegal and should be withdrawn.

INFO - Comment: The Administration's new proposed rule does little to correct the underlying problems in its contraceptive mandate, which continues to violate many Americans' right of religious freedom. <br/><br/>The rule exempts only an extremely narrow set of religious employers, primarily "houses of worship."   Almost all private health plans must cover sterilization and all FDA-approved "contraceptives," including drugs that can cause abortion, as well as "education and counseling" promoting these to women and girls.  This coverage will be imposed "automatically" even on the employees of many religious organizations and their children.  Employers and employees will lose their right to seek health coverage that respects their values. I urge you to allow all organizations and individuals to offer, sponsor and obtain health coverage that does not violate their moral and religious convictions.

INFO - Comment: Alexander Acosta,<br/><br/>Back in 1975, President Gerald Fords Labor Department set the salary level for overtime exemption at the equivalent of about $58,000 in todays dollarshigh enough to cover more than 50 percent of full-time salaried workers. The Obama-era rule set it at $47,476high enough to cover about 34 percent of full-time salaried employees but lower than the level that it was in the 1970s. Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people. The whole point of having national standards is to ensure decent basic standards for all workers. The updated overtime standard is already linked to the lowest-wage Census region. Workers rights and wages should not be undercut even further by weakening the salary threshold.<br/><br/>Gail Gollon<br/>ggollo@mail.com<br/>5662 Crescent View Dr<br/>Stevens Point, Wisconsin 54482

Doing so defends the worst actors of the oil and gas industry, and puts their interests above the health and safety of American families and their communities, all while wasting taxpayer dollars. According to BLMs own analysis, weakening the Rule will allow $824 million worth of publicly-owned natural gas to be wasted over the next decade.   States like Colorado and the best companies in the business have made it clear that this problem can be fixed using available, low-cost technologies. And the majority of Americans want to see strong protections implemented.   Without public hearings, their voices aren't being heard. Please establish public hearings across the West so that the Americans affected by this proposal can give their input.   And instead of moving forward with this dangerous new proposal, please leave in place the current limits that effectively protect Americans' health, safety, and wallets.

INFO - Comment: Dear US Fish and Wildlife Service,<br/><br/>I am writing to support your proposal to rescind the last administration’s ill-devised definition of “habitat” under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which limits the ability of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to establish critical habitat for listed species by limiting what counts as habitat, specifically by excluding areas that may require some restoration to allow critically imperiled species to recover. <br/><br/>The definition limits protections to habitat that could currently support species now, but not areas that could be restored or safeguarded to provide additional habitat for future recovery. This is especially damaging in areas with lots of degraded habitat, or in places like Hawaii where endemic island species have nowhere else to go. It is also myopic given that climate change will force species  to relocate.  <br/><br/>I urge you to finalize this rule rescinding this harmful and limiting definition of habitat, and I urge you to take further administrative action to reverse all of the harmful regulations put in place by the last administration, including those from 2019.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Thomas Wolslegel<br/>46 B Snowberry Cir  South Deerfield, MA 01373-9621

INFO - Title: Comment from Avellino, Frank
INFO - Comment: Dear Acting Secretary Julie Su,<br/><br/>I appreciate and support the efforts of the Department of Labor to expand overtime protections to more workers across the country. This effort will help millions of workers, including education support professionals, making less than $55,068 per year. While raising the overtime salary threshold is a massive step forward, teachers deserve these same wage protections. The current Fair Labor Standards Act regulations unfairly exclude them from wage protections, and the proposed rule wouldn’t change that exclusion. Under the proposal, teachers are exempt from overtime even if they are paid below the FLSA salary threshold. The only other professions treated similarly are doctors and lawyers, and it makes no sense to treat teachers the same as these highly compensated professionals.  <br/><br/>While I support the Department of Labor’s efforts to protect more workers, the department must take steps to protect teachers earning less than $55,068 per year. Without changes to how the FLSA’s regulations treat teachers, the wage penalty teachers experience—the disconnect between what teachers earn in comparison to similarly educated professionals—will continue to grow.  The Department of Labor has the chance to create an equitable work environment by providing wage protections for teachers.  <br/><br/>Young teachers, teachers of color, women, and higher education professionals (contingent or adjuncts) in particular would benefit from eliminating the teacher exclusion regulations. Providing wage protections to these groups would not only help achieve equity; it would also help ease the teacher shortage by attracting more people to the profession. <br/><br/>The Department of Labor’s efforts to grant more workers overtime protections are a major step in the right direction. However, the department can and should do more to support all workers.  I urge the Department of Labor to issue a proposed regulation rescinding the teacher exclusion so that teachers whose salaries fall below the threshold can earn the overtime pay they deserve.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr Frank Avellino<br/>185 Prospect Ave Apt 3B Hackensack, NJ 07601-2212<br/>frank@bozandthebard.com

INFO - Title: Private Individual - R. Wetherington
INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Becerra,<br/><br/>I write to comment on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families, “Safe and Appropriate Foster Care Placement Requirements for Titles IV-E and IV-B” (RIN: 0970-AD03).<br/><br/>This rule would impose an ideological agenda on the foster care system, to the detriment of children and the exclusion of people of faith. In the name of affirming adult choices, the rule would significantly reduce resources for children by falsely labeling people and religious organizations “unsafe” and “inappropriate.”<br/><br/>The proposed rule would force states to screen foster parents and foster-care organizations, making sure that they will “affirm” LGBT identities of children in their care, in the name of ensuring “safe and appropriate” care. But affirming a child’s self-proclaimed sexual identity, without regard for his or her sex, is harmful, and requiring it will exclude good people and organizations from an already over-taxed system. The new criteria would disqualify most faith-based providers and would essentially label people of faith and religious organizations “unsafe”!<br/><br/>This rule is predicated upon at least two false premises. First, it uncritically accepts the assertion that we must “affirm” a child’s sexual identity or risk pushing them toward suicide. Increasingly, there is better evidence that shows “gender affirming care” is causing more mental health distress rather than resolving it.<br/><br/>In fact, high-quality studies show that completed suicides do not go down when people are “affirmed” in a transgender identity, and that the overwhelming majority of children who are not “affirmed” in a transgender identity desist by the time they go through puberty—up to 70 percent of girls, and up to 98 percent of boys. It is essential to note the other increased risk factors for suicide that have been cited in the transgender-identifying population, namely a significantly greater incidence of adverse childhood experiences. A recent study, for example, from the pro-LGBT Williams Institute showed 45 percent of transgender identifying people reported childhood sexual abuse, 44 percent of transgender-identifying people reported childhood physical abuse, and fully 75 percent of transgender-identifying people reported childhood emotional abuse.<br/><br/>For the trauma survivor, an ideology that suggests a child can be born in the wrong body, unfortunately, fits hand-in-glove with the mentality of a person who self-harms and wants to dissociate from any aspect of their being or body that highlights vulnerability. Yet, despite this knowledge, clinical settings and research studies promoting transgenderism have not properly accounted for this significant variable and how it relates to gender dysphoria. These three resources explore these problems in greater detail: “Suicide Risk and Gender Transition: The Facts” (https://www.frc.org/blog/2021/07/suicide-risk-and-gender-transition-facts), “Do Not Sterilize Children: Why Physiological Gender Transition Procedures for Minors Should Be Prohibited” (https://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF20J34.pdf), and “The Trans Youth Phenomenon: Critiques & Hard Questions” (https://www.frc.org/booklet/the-trans-youth-phenomenon-critiques-hard-questions).<br/><br/>Second, it labels any foster-care family or institutional provider "unsafe” and “inappropriate.” This is dangerous ground both legally and practically. Legally, it infringes on the right of people of faith to continue to make an outsized contribution providing homes and services to children in the foster-care system. Practically, it threatens to dramatically restrict the number of homes and service providers available to help children in an already strained system.<br/><br/>Foster care agencies have already been affected by challenges to the religious freedom of providers or foster families. This rule will further discourage religious families and individuals from applying to be foster parents or seeking employment in the foster-care profession. Religious people who worry that their sincerely held religious beliefs are deemed to not be “safe and appropriate” by the federal government are likely to think twice before entering the child welfare system. We need more, not fewer, loving families to open their homes for children in the child welfare system, and more, not fewer, individuals to dedicate their lives to helping these children. HHS should not be applying pressure on state agencies to discourage faith-based providers and religious families.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this rule will only harm, not help, children in foster care. For these reasons, I oppose implementation of this rule.

INFO - Comment: I strongly oppose the proposed rule to revise the definition of “harm” under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). For over four decades, this definition has rightly included habitat destruction that kills or injures wildlife by impairing essential behaviors like breeding, feeding, and sheltering. Changing this definition would gut the ESA’s power to prevent extinction and serve no legitimate conservation purpose.<br/><br/>The ESA’s statutory language includes “harm” as a distinct form of “take,” and courts—including the U.S. Supreme Court in Babbitt v. Sweet Home—have affirmed that this includes habitat modification. The agencies cannot now reverse this longstanding interpretation simply by deleting the regulation, especially when the science remains clear: habitat loss is the leading driver of species extinction.<br/><br/>This proposed rule is not only ecologically destructive, but legally unsound. It attempts to override the ESA’s text and structure, dismisses reliance interests, and avoids proper environmental review. I urge the agencies to withdraw this rule and reaffirm their duty to enforce the ESA in a way that protects wildlife and the places they need to survive.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Dr DiVanna VaDree<br/>17024 38th Ave W  Lynnwood, WA 98037-7010<br/>divannav@earthkink.net

INFO - Comment: I am writing to urge you to stop the changes to longstanding regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act you recently proposed. These changes would drastically weaken the interagency consultation provision of the Endangered Species Act -- widely considered the most important and effective provision of the Act -- and also undercut the Endangered Species Act's proper role in addressing the impacts of climate change on our nation's most imperiled wildlife. <br/><br/>For 35 years the Endangered Species Act has protected imperiled species from the effects of potentially harmful federal projects. The strength of the Endangered Species Act has been the checks and balances created by interagency consultation between federal agencies that build roads, issue logging permits, and lease oil and gas rights among other projects, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and National Marine Fisheries Services, whose primary responsibility is the conservation of endangered species. <br/><br/>Interagency consultation ensures that federal projects that may impact America's most imperiled wildlife are independently reviewed by federal wildlife experts and project modifications are made where necessary. In the overwhelming majority of consultations federal projects move forward with little or no significant changes.<br/><br/>The regulations you recently proposed would eliminate interagency consultation on thousands of federal projects that pose a risk to endangered and threatened species each year. The changes will almost certainly result in detrimental impacts on endangered and imperiled species and a higher propensity to overlook opportunities to avoid such impacts.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the fact that these are the most significant changes to regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act in more than 20 years, you have provided the public just 30 days in which to submit comments, not the traditional 90, and prevented anyone from sending their comments by email. <br/><br/>I request you set an additional 60 days to allow the public an opportunity to meaningfully comment on these proposed regulations.<br/><br/>I also urge you to not to finalize these regulatory changes. <br/><br/>Thank you.

I concur that this system must be mandatory and nutrient-specific, include calories, and call attention to high levels of added sugars, sodium, and saturated fat. These nutrients are over-consumed by Americans and contribute to chronic disease. <br/><br/>An expansive body of scientific evidence supports the adoption of a FOPNL system that meets these criteria in order to improve the nutritional quality of consumers food choices, promote understanding of the nutritional contents of foods, and prompt food manufacturers to make healthy reformulations of packaged foods. <br/><br/>I am dismayed that the United States has become one of the nations with the greatest need for, but scantest action on, such public health nutrition interventions. The average American adult consumes 50% more sodium, 40% more added sugars, and 40% more saturated fat than recommended daily. Meanwhile, approximately 116 million U.S. adults (47% of the adult population) have hypertension, 37 million Americans (11% of the population) have diabetes (and approximately 90-95% of these cases are Type 2 diabetes), and 20 million U.S. adults (7% of adults) have coronary artery disease. Each of these conditions is strongly linked to excess intake of added sugar, salt, or saturated fat.<br/><br/>The time has come for FDA to take bold action to improve our nations diet and health. Please prioritize this evidence-based policy and develop a mandatory FOPNL system for the United States. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>David Webster<br/>Kansas City, MO

INFO - Comment: The Gulf of Mexico plays a significant part in our country's energy strategy. Therefore, I believe any action that would fundamentally impact energy production in the Gulf of Mexico should be approached carefully and transparently. For that reason, I am writing today to voice my opposition to the National Marine Fisheries Services' (NMFS) proposed designation of a critical habitat for the Rice's whale. <br/><br/>First, this area is essential to meeting the world's energy demand. Oil produced in the Gulf of Mexico accounts for approximately 15% of our total crude oil production. And this is a good thing because the Gulf of Mexico produces one of the world's least carbon-intensive barrels of oil. Limiting output in the region could create a major supply gap, threaten the ability to meet energy demand, and ultimately weaken U.S. energy security. The last thing we need is to exacerbate existing supply issues. <br/><br/>Second, on the topic of supply, the Gulf Coast also plays an essential role in our supply chain. Possible future nighttime and speed restrictions resulting from the critical habitat designation could impede the functionality of vital marine transportation hubs in places like Houston, Galveston, New Orleans, and Corpus Christi. This could create a myriad of additional concerns and pressures on our economy. <br/><br/>Finally, the available data cannot justify this expansive critical habitat designation. One study, which is the basis for this proposed designation, acknowledges its limited findings and that researchers cannot conclusively report the Rice whale's distribution and range in the area in question. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I ask that you not designate critical habitat in the areas proposed or withdraw this critical habitat designation for the rice whale in the Gulf of Mexico.

INFO - Title: MM3 Comment from grace ramirez,
INFO - Comment: Dear Chairman Neumayr:<br/><br/>I?m writing today to urge you to withdraw the draft rules proposed by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Your proposed rewrite of the NEPA regulations would gravely undermine environmental protections, including for the oceans, and reduce my opportunities as a citizen to participate in the federal government?s environment-related decisions.<br/><br/>Passed in 1970 with overwhelming bipartisan support, NEPA is considered the ?Magna Carta? of environmental law in the United States. NEPA requires the federal government to engage in a review process designed to identify and publicly disclose any significant environmental, social, economic, or public health impacts a federal action may have, before a decision is made. Federal actions include not only actions implemented directly by federal government agencies, but also authorizations and permits issued by the federal government for private and non-federal activities, such as offshore drilling.<br/><br/>NEPA has a strong track record of promoting informed government decision-making and allowing the public the opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of proposed federal actions and alternatives to those actions. In many cases, NEPA is the only law that gives citizens the opportunity to weigh in on federal actions impacting their communities and livelihoods.<br/><br/>A couple recent examples show the importance of the NEPA process for protecting our oceans:<br/><br/>?<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Offshore oil exploration and drilling is a private activity that requires federal government permits and authorizations. The NEPA process has enabled a wide range of stakeholders along our coasts to raise grave concerns about the impact of offshore oil drilling on our fisheries and coastal economies. The Administration?s offshore leasing plan is currently on hold because of opposition from coastal communities.<br/><br/>?<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The NEPA process was crucial in a recent review of protected fish habitat in New England. An environmental impact statement showed that certain areas required continued conservation to protect the overfished Georges Bank Atlantic cod.<br/><br/>Although NEPA is a broad law that applies to every ?major federal action? the government takes, the actual law is very short, which makes CEQ?s rules for carrying out the law especially important. The draft rules issued in January would gravely weaken implementation of NEPA because they would:<br/><br/>?<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Create new exemptions that would reduce the number and types of federal actions that would receive environmental review and public input.<br/><br/>?<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Exclude consideration of ?cumulative impacts? of a federal project or action and instead require that environmental impacts be ?reasonably foreseeable? and have a ?reasonably close causal relationship to the proposed action? to be considered in the review process This change would exclude consideration of climate change impacts, among others.

INFO - Title: Comment from Sucklal, Sirina
INFO - Comment: I’m writing to express support for the Department of Labor’s proposed rule to guarantee overtime pay for workers making less than $55,068 per year. The new rule will make it harder for employers to require low-paid employees to work 60- or 70-hour weeks without any guarantee of overtime pay. And the automatic increase to the salary level every three years will help make sure overtime protections keep up with wage growth and inflation. This rule is long overdue for workers like me.<br/><br/>About two million women, including 700,000 women of color, will benefit from this updated rule by finally being more adequately compensated for their time and labor. For some newly covered workers, overtime protection will mean hundreds of dollars in additional pay each week; for others, it will mean more time outside of work to spend with their families. Others will get an increase in their salaries to the new threshold. And as some employers shift schedules to accommodate overtime costs, employees who had been involuntarily working part-time may gain the additional hours they want and need. All of this will mean more money and time in the pockets of workers (especially women of color), their families and their communities.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Sirina Sucklal

INFO - Comment: I am an educator and a member of the National Education Association and I urge the U.S. Department of Education to support the flexibility afforded to local stakeholders, including educators like me, by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). Educators are experts at working with students and helping them reach their potential and we are ready to lead implementation efforts in our communities so students have access to the public schools they deserve.<br/><br/>I am hopeful about the Department's support and promotion of ESSA's stakeholder engagement requirements in the proposed regulations, and recommend that these provisions be strengthened to ensure not just input, but two-way dialogue aimed at reaching consensus among stakeholders. Additionally, the final regulations should explicitly say that stakeholder engagement should include meetings that educators actually can attend, and that the engagement extends throughout the implementation process.<br/><br/>However, I implore the Department not to short-circuit the stakeholder engagement process it professes to support by taking away from that process the very decisions that ESSA says states, districts, educators, parents, and other stakeholders should make - with the aim of that engagement being providing all students a better education.<br/><br/>I urge the Department to promote transparency about school quality by dropping language in the regulations that would reduce the entirety of a school's performance to a summative number or grade.  The Department should instead promote a rich data dashboard on multiple academic and school quality indicators that will truly inform parents and others charged with heling students and improving schools.<br/><br/>I urge the Department to promote equity by dropping the proposed regulations' new restrictions on the use of school quality and student support indicators ("Opportunity Indicators") in the accountability system.  ESSA for the first time requires an Opportunity Indicator, not just test scores and graduation rates, to be an indicator for measuring and improving schools.  The Department should promote, not undermine, school quality and student support indicators since they are the best way to ensure every student has access to a quality public school.<br/><br/>I urge the Department not to take away my voice in the implementation process by using the regulatory process to restrict our community-led innovative solutions and opting to add requirements in the regulations that, according to ESSA, were left to states and districts in consultation with stakeholders.  For example, the Department should drop the timelines for improvement, limits on interventions, and definitions of consistently underperforming that conflict with ESSA.   <br/><br/>I urge the Department to learn the lessons of NCLB's failed interventions by dropping its list of recommendations for draconian interventions in schools, such as school closure, and allow stakeholders to determine appropriate creative, community-based interventions for struggling, under-resourced public schools as envisioned and outlined by ESSA so that all students have greater opportunities for a good education.<br/><br/>I urge the Department to respect the decision by Congress to let states determine the weight and impact of any students who are opted out of testing by their parents instead of inserting proposed penalties into the regulations. The best way for the Department to promote test participation is to continue its campaign for better and fewer tests, which will create confidence in parents that tests have a role beyond labeling and punishing schools.<br/><br/>In closing, I look forward to seeing my views and those of educators across the country reflected in the final regulations. I have every confidence in my fellow educators to help come up with strong, creative solutions that help all students excel and reach their full potential.

Five Tribal nations, Hopi, Navajo, Uintah and Ouray Ute Indian Tribe, Ute Mountain Ute and Zuni tribes came together, for the first time ever, to protect their shared sacred land by advocating for Bears Ears to be made a national monument. Now the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition is working to protect the national monument, and maintain its integrity. Hear me, and the overwhelming number of people who agree with me: PUBLIC LANDS BELONG IN PUBLIC HANDS. It is your job as the Secretary of the Dept. of Interior to protect and safeguard our national treasures.
