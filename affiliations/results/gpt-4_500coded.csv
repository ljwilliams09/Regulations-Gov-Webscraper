HHS-OCR-2019-0007-118219,Comment on FR Doc # 2019-11512,American Civil Liberties Union,There's a reason why the Health Care Rights Law exists. Transgender and non-binary people are continuously denied medically necessary health care and harassed by medical providers. The same goes for people who seek reproductive care - including abortion care.  Making it harder for historically marginalized groups of people to access critical health care is an act of violence. I demand that you drop this proposed rule and withdraw it in its entirety.,,

Anthony List,"To My senators and congressmen and anyone else to whom it may concern :<br/><br/>Today I write in strong support of the proposed rule titled: Compliance With Statutory Program Integrity Requirements (HHS-OS-2018-0008), also known as the Protect Life Rule.<br/><br/>The proposed rule seeks to reinstate Reagan-era prohibitions on Title X funding for abortion centers. Similar regulations were upheld by the Supreme Court in 1991 in Rust v. Sullivan (500 U.S. 173).<br/><br/>Abortion is not family planning. This rule would draw a bright line between abortion and family planning, as was clearly intended in the statute.<br/><br/>Currently 266 Planned Parenthood abortion centers are also federal Title X locations. Planned Parenthood is the nations largest abortion business and receives $50-$60 million a year from Title X. They should not be entitled to treat Title X as their personal slush fund. Research released by the Charlotte Lozier Institute in 2018 shows Planned Parenthood has inflated the U.S. abortion rate, controlling more than 35% of the abortion industry and resulting in more than three million extra abortions that could have been avoided.<br/><br/>American taxpayers do not want to be complicit in abortions through their taxpayer dollars. According to a January 2018 Marist poll, six in ten Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion. Money is fungible and tax dollars should be invested in comprehensive health care alternatives, not used as a slush fund to prop up the abortion industry.<br/><br/>It's important to note that the proposed rule will not reduce family planning funding by a single dollar. This rule would simply direct taxpayer funds to family planning providers who stay out of the abortion business. Women and girls are best served at alternative health care centers including community and rural health care centers that outnumber Planned Parenthood abortion facilities by more than 20 to 1 nationwide.<br/><br/>I strongly urge adoption of the rule.<br/>  Life is not a joke. It is not something to take lightly. Life is precious . We must strive to protect It ! <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Ellen Concannon<br/>New Jersey",,

HHS-OCR-2019-0007-116102,Comment on FR Doc # 2019-11512,Susan B. Anthony List,"Dear Secretary Azar,<br/> <br/>I am writing in support of certain aspects of HHSOCR20190007, the proposed rule regarding section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. The proposed rule eliminates an Obama-era definition of ""discrimination on the basis of sex"" designed to force healthcare providers to participate in brutal abortions.  Instead the proposed rule clearly articulates longstanding laws protecting the rights of health care entities like doctors, nurses and hospitals to abstain from involvement in abortion. I support these changes.<br/> <br/>The current Obama-era regulations implementing section 1557 define ""discrimination on the basis of sex"" to include ""termination of pregnancy"" in a manner that goes far beyond the statutory authority provided to the Secretary.  For this reason the regulations was challenged in Franciscan Alliance v. Burwell and a district court issued a nationwide injunction against it.<br/> <br/>The proposed rules provide much needed clarity regarding the freedom of health care workers and facilities to practice medicine in accordance with their own judgement. Americans need and want access to quality healthcare providers.  A vast majority of health care providers do not engage in abortion.  At a time when our nation needs more, not less, healthcare workers and facilities, it is unconscionable to force them to carry out abortions or leave the medical field.<br/> <br/>This is a matter of access to healthcare. Abortion is not healthcare, rather it is the taking of a vulnerable life. We must ensure that healthcare providers allowed to continue providing life-affirming care to millions of Americans.  I support the provisions of the proposed rule eliminating the definition of ""discrimination on the basis of sex"" that includes ""termination of pregnancy"" and the application of longstanding protections for healthcare entities that refuse to participate in abortion.<br/> <br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Robyn Loughran<br/>Indiana",,

NOAA-NMFS-2009-0029-1976,"Comment from Linda Courtney, Center for Biological Diversity",Center for Biological Diversity,"I am writing to urge the National Marine Fisheries Service to immediately enforce the Marine Mammal Protection Act Section 101 by banning swordfish imports until exporting countries demonstrate that their swordfish catch meets U.S. standards for protecting marine mammals.  This 36-year-old law protects dozens of species of dolphins, porpoises, sea lions, whales, and other species I care about while safeguarding U.S. fishers from unfair competition with unregulated foreign fishing fleets.  The time is long overdue to enforce the law and ban swordfish imports.<br/><br/>Congress recognized that fishing posed a threat to marine mammal species when it passed this provision of the Marine Mammal Protection Act over 30 years ago.  Enforcement of Marine Mammal Protection Act provisions for U.S. fisheries has led to the establishment of significant protective measures aimed at restricting harmful fishing practices and protecting marine mammal populations from unsustainable fisheries bycatch.  Congress also recognized that, if the United States' efforts to protect marine mammals from fisheries bycatch were to be successful, it would have to exert pressure on fisheries of other nations to adopt similarly protective measures.<br/><br/>The Marine Mammal Protection Act requires that all fisheries meet a ""zero mortality rate goal"" - in other words, that they reduce incidental death and serious injury of marine mammals to as close to zero as possible. This requirement has led to a number of important regulations on U.S. fishing, including gear-based requirements such as the use of pingers and net extenders, limits on the length of longlines, and as other measures like time-area closures, safe handling and release training and equipment, and mandatory observer coverage. All of these measures play a vital role in reducing fisheries' impact on populations of marine mammals and other species.<br/><br/>Banning swordfish imports until source countries demonstrate that they meet these important standards would use U.S. market power to protect marine species I care about around the world and protect the economic interests of domestic fisheries. Therefore, I strongly urge the National Marine Fisheries Service to implement the ban immediately. Thank you for your attention to this important issue.",,

FWS-R9-ES-2008-0093-20656,Comment on FR Doc # E8-18938,Center for Biological Diversity,"I am writing to urge you to stop the changes to longstanding regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act you recently proposed. These changes would drastically weaken the interagency consultation provision of the Endangered Species Act -- widely considered the most important and effective provision of the Act -- and also undercut the Endangered Species Act's proper role in addressing the impacts of climate change on our nation's most imperiled wildlife. <br/><br/>For 35 years the Endangered Species Act has protected imperiled species from the effects of potentially harmful federal projects. The strength of the Endangered Species Act has been the checks and balances created by interagency consultation between federal agencies that build roads, issue logging permits, and lease oil and gas rights among other projects, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and National Marine Fisheries Services, whose primary responsibility is the conservation of endangered species. <br/><br/>Interagency consultation ensures that federal projects that may impact America's most imperiled wildlife are independently reviewed by federal wildlife experts and project modifications are made where necessary. In the overwhelming majority of consultations federal projects move forward with little or no significant changes.<br/><br/>The regulations you recently proposed would eliminate interagency consultation on thousands of federal projects that pose a risk to endangered and threatened species each year. The changes will almost certainly result in detrimental impacts on endangered and imperiled species and a higher propensity to overlook opportunities to avoid such impacts.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the fact that these are the most significant changes to regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act in more than 20 years, you have provided the public just 30 days in which to submit comments, not the traditional 90, and prevented anyone from sending their comments by email. <br/><br/>I request you set an additional 60 days to allow the public an opportunity to meaningfully comment on these proposed regulations.<br/><br/>I also urge you to not to finalize these regulatory changes. <br/><br/>Thank you.",,

I support the need to protect threatened and endangered species, but when existing, approved Forest Plans have identified and taken into account these wildlife needs, species-specific concerns and analysis of potential impacts of specific actions should be addressed at the forest project level. <br/><br/>This rule clarifies that consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service is not required of federal agencies a programmatic (forest or land-management plan) level when new information becomes available, new critical habitat is designated, or a new species is listed for a project that is taking place within the guidelines of the plan. Consultation requirements for proposed projects within the plan remain in place. Potential impacts to listed species, species-specific concerns and analysis of specific actions are most appropriately addressed at the project level.<br/><br/>The lack of clarity on this consultation process is resulting in unnecessary litigation that drains time and resources we can ill afford to lose.

BLS-2024-0001-23968,Comment on FR Doc # 2024-12825,American Society of Radiologic Technologists,"As a member of the American Society of Radiologic Technologists, I respectfully submit public comment to the Office of Management and Budget to consider updating the classification of diagnostic radiologic technologists to professional under 29-2030.  <br/><br/>Radiologic technologists work at the intersection of innovation in medical technology and direct patient care. This requires us to exercise critical thinking daily, not only as part of a larger health care delivery team but also individually when deciding how best to provide care based on each patient’s particular needs. <br/><br/>Radiologic technologists are similar in a broad sense to a variety of other health care workers who are required to exercise critical thinking and independent judgment as part of their daily jobs. The job of the radiologic technologist involves operating imaging equipment to capture images of a patient’s internal body structures and troubleshooting systems to ensure diagnostic-quality images. They collaborate with radiologists, ensuring that diagnostic-quality images are captured through the appropriate imaging modality. For example, a technologist must use certain imaging techniques for a trauma patient to assure safe imaging and accurate diagnosis.  Capturing elbow images that allow for diagnosis on a patient who walks in is quite different than capturing images for a patient with significant trauma. Radiologic technologists work autonomously to use their knowledge, tools and critical thinking skills to capture diagnostic images. If images are not diagnostic, the radiologist may miss a diagnosis. Radiologic technologists must enforce strict radiation protocols throughout their work, and they have a critical role in patient care: providing instructions to patients and ensuring patients are comfortable and safe during procedures.   <br/><br/>The role of the radiologic technologist in the modern health care industry continues to evolve as the demand for improved imaging technology accelerates. This has made radiologic technologists more essential and has required more specialization. Therefore, I believe it appropriate that the SOC occupational definition for radiologic technologists be reconsidered to more accurately reflect the increasingly professional responsibilities of this occupation. Additionally, technologists’ therapy counterparts, radiation therapists, are already classified as professionals, and they ensure a similar level of patient management and critical thinking as radiologic technologists every day. <br/><br/>I urge the OMB to take this opportunity to revise the SOC occupational definitions to provide important updates to the radiologic technologist definition that reflect the growing importance of the profession. I urge the OMB to update definition to more clearly designates the radiologic technologist as a professional. This would more accurately reflect the actual practice of this vital health care role and ensure that this profession is properly characterized. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to present these comments for the OMB’s possible revision of the SOC for 2028.",,

Under the current Donated Resources Policy, donated resources, including hours for “mass food and sheltering of victims” are only eligible if those activities are not part of the mission of the donating organization.<br/><br/>Established voluntary agencies whose mission includes providing assistance with mass care and sheltering activities are the very organizations that have the expertise and capacity to provide such mass care assistance.  These organizations provide such service at a cost far less than if government agencies were to provide that service directly (which would be reimbursable if such services were provided by government agencies).   The expertise of organizations whose mission it is to provide mass care services is critically needed particularly with respect to the care of persons living in shelters and making sure that food safety is properly maintained.<br/><br/>We fully support the proposed changes to the policy.   The proposed change in policy provides a financial incentive for local governments to develop relationships and partnerships with voluntary agencies that provide such services.   Essentially as the policy currently stands, only the hours of spontaneous volunteers could be counted toward the non-federals share, which is contrary to the best practices of volunteer management and federal guidance given to local and state stakeholders that encourages the use of affiliated volunteers and agencies.<br/><br/>We appreciate FEMA's leadership in making this proposed change which will significantly impact local communities’ ability to recover from a disaster.<br/>",,

NOAA-NMFS-2022-0022-10397,"Comment from Skidmore, Evelyn",None,"Dear Caroline Good,<br/><br/>I write to you as one of In Defense of Animals 250,000 supporters, to speak in support of the proposed rule to amend vessel speed regulations in relation to North Atlantic right whales. I also urge you to take more protective measures to ensure the survival of this species and to continue efforts to create ropeless fishing gear. <br/> <br/>As you know, there are less than 350 North Atlantic right whales alive, a number so low that for every one of them, there are 22,857,143 of us humans, and the most common threats to these beautiful and critically endangered whales are boat collisions and entanglement in fishing gear. The most vulnerable to boat collision deaths are mother whales with their calves. Recently, a whale known as Infinity and her calf were struck off the coast of Florida by a sportfishing yacht. Infinity suffered painful injuries and her calf sadly passed away.<br/> <br/>I support the proposed amendments to the vessel speed rule to expand the seasonal speed zone boundaries and to include boats from 35 to 65 feet long in the rule. I also support the change to mandatory dynamic speed zones. <br/> <br/>The proposed amendments to the vessel speed rule are a huge step in the right direction, but I encourage the NOAA Fisheries to take additional measures to protect right whales. <br/> <br/>First, the dynamic management areas should be implemented when a minimum of one right whale is detected, not three, which would include vulnerable mother-calf pairs. <br/> <br/>Second, the seasonal speed zone should be expanded to the New Hampshire border to protect whales in a wider range. <br/> <br/>Third, military vessels and federally owned and operated vessels should not be exempted from this rule. <br/> <br/>Finally, the rule should also establish year-long protections for right whales along New England where boat traffic is particularly high and right whales are known to be present year-round.<br/> <br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed amendment to the rule, and for working to protect North Atlantic right whales.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Evelyn Skidmore",,
FS-2018-0059-8960,Comment on FR Doc # 2018-18937,Backcountry Hunters & Anglers,"As a supporter of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers and our wild public lands, waters and wildlife, I am very concerned with the rule-making process announced in Federal Register Document Number 2018-18937. I am writing these comments to strongly encourage you to maintain Roadless Area protections for the Tongass and all of America's national forests. These public lands and waters are prized by sportsmen and women and are a mainstay of Alaska's economy. Nationally they help drive an $887 billion economic engine from outdoor recreation like hunting and fishing. <br/><br/>At nearly 17 million acres, the Tongass is the nation's largest national forest and the world's largest remaining intact coastal temperate rainforest. Of that wild backcountry, 9.3 million acres are inventoried roadless areas providing high quality habitat for a unique diversity of sought-after game species, including mountain goats, black-tailed deer and both brown and black bears. The Tongass also encompasses thousands of miles of salmon-rich waterways, legendary among anglers and fundamental to the state's commercial salmon industry. The commercial fishing sector alone relies on the Tongass for more than 80 percent of its salmon and employs more than 4,300 people in the region, accounting for 9 percent of the area's entire employment. By contrast, timber production accounts for only 1 percent of the region's jobs.<br/><br/>If done poorly, a state rule-making process could set a slippery precedent that unravels Roadless Rule protections for fish and wildlife across all of our nation's wild roadless forest lands including the Chugach National Forest just to the north and west. If any state rule-making process does move forward, the 2001 Roadless Rule should be the benchmark for improvements so that roadless policies only enhance the most important fish and wildlife habitats while preventing new development, road building and resource extraction.<br/><br/>Currently, these valuable resources are upheld by the Roadless Area Conservation Rule, a collaborative management approach adopted following one of the most extensive public engagement campaigns in the history of federal rulemaking. I implore you to maintain the integrity of what may be America's best and most popular land management rule in history. The costs to American taxpayers for road building and unconscionably subsidized resource extraction are too high, not to mention the irreparable impact to wildlife, water and outdoor traditions like hunting and fishing.",,

FDA-2017-D-6580-12344,Request for Extension from Rebekah Callahan,None,"As a supporter of Americans for Homeopathy Choice, I request that the FDA grant a 180-day extension to the Notice-and-Comment Period for this Draft Guidance. I and my fellow homeopathy supporters commend the FDA for listening to the homeopathy community and posting a revised Draft Guidance rather than finalizing the previous one. However, we believe that the revised guidance raises many new questions that require considerable clarification by parties interested in the regulation of homeopathy and therefore ask that additional time be granted in order to obtain that clarification.<br/><br/>Specifically, those areas needing clarification have been set out by Americans for Homeopathy Choice and include the following:<br/><br/>1. The FDA claims that it has the authority to withdraw any and all generic name homeopathic medicines from the marketplace across all manufacturers without first proving that such medicines pose a danger to the public.<br/><br/>We understand ""generic name homeopathic medicines"" to mean substances diluted in accordance with homeopathic guidelines using diluents recognized as safe for such purposes such as sterile water, alcohol or glycerin so as to be nontoxic to humans and which are recognized by the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States and its supplements. These generic name homeopathic medicines may be included in branded single medicine homeopathic products such as Chamomilla (chamomile) or included in products which contain more than one generic name homeopathic medicine, often called combination products.<br/><br/>2. We would like the FDA to distinguish the claim of authority in item 1 from the FDA's authority to withdraw manufacturer-branded, distributor-branded, and store-branded homeopathic products or lots thereof which are improperly manufactured and/or labeled. Improperly manufactured and/or labeled products claiming to be homeopathic may pose a danger to the public precisely because they do not meet homeopathic standards. We would like the FDA to comment on our belief that these improperly manufactured and/or labeled substances are the products that concern the FDA and would like a clarification from you about the accuracy of this belief.<br/><br/>We believe that the problems with these products may be because of their concentration, their labeling instructions or their purity or because they are mixed with active ingredients that are not recognized as homeopathic. Does the FDA, in fact, acknowledge 1) that the problem in these cases results from products that have been labeled as homeopathic but which are NOT homeopathic and 2) that any concerns reflect solely on the manufacturer, distributor or store and cannot be attributed to the generic name homeopathic medicines purported to be in the products? If not, why not?<br/><br/>3. The FDA claims that homeopathic medicines are ""new drugs"" under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 and its amendments. We would like more information on how the FDA arrived at this conclusion, particularly whether federal law states anywhere that homeopathic medicines are ""new drugs.""<br/><br/>4. The FDA claims that its risk-based approach to regulating homeopathic medicines will, in fact, reduce risk. We would like more information about how withdrawing nontoxic, inherently safe, properly manufactured and labeled homeopathic medicines would reduce risk to consumers who 1) gain benefit from them for various conditions and 2) more specifically, desire to treat illnesses and infections without risking antibiotic resistance and wish to treat pain without risking opioid dependence and death.<br/><br/>We would like more information on why the FDA believes it would reduce risk to consumers by focusing additional enforcement resources on properly manufactured and labeled homeopathic medicines (which are by design nontoxic and inherently safe) instead of on pharmaceuticals and medical devices which have inherent dangers even when they are properly manufactured and labeled.<br/><br/>Americans for Homeopathy Choice has asked for clarifications on these issues. We support obtaining clarifications on these points.<br/><br/>To allow enough time to obtain these clarifications, I once again ask the FDA to grant a 180-day extension to the Notice-and-Comment Period for this Draft Guidance.",,

CMS-2018-0077-0228,"RX Home Health Services, Inc--FL","RX Home Health Services, Inc--FL","I have been committed to the home health care industry for almost 40 years. The collective impact of the changes that are being proposed will destroy thousands of small business across the country who have been dedicated to providing high quality home health services to our valued seniors. As an example the Request for Anticipated Payment (RAP) has financed the quality care that has been provided to the Greatest Generation. Many small HHAs like mine depend on RAPs because of the time it takes to bill final claims as well as paying field staff for services rendered. I have heard that there is a significant percentage of home health agencies across the country that do not bill the rap till late in the episode or even before the final claim. I am sure if you looked more closely you would see that those agencies have broken processes and are not running efficiently. They might be providing quality care but you could argue that they are sloppy and lax in their billing and processing of claims. Please do not penalize honest hardworking providers just because some agencies are able to limp along without the RAP. I must also point out that physicians continue to be a major factor in delaying the billing and payment of final claims. It is not a priority for them and they simply do not care. In addition, the level of chart review and inspection (QA) has created an even greater expense for small agencies because of the new Conditions for Participation. One of two full time equivalents (FTEs) had to be hired in order to ensure compliance where in the past the Director of Nursing could QA patient records in preparation to bill final claims. Many of the proposed changes disproportionality hurt the smaller agencies and those are the vary agencies that take any patient that is referred to them. Many of the larger organizations are far more selective in the type of referrals they desire and accept. These changes will undoubtably drive many providers out of business but will that truly accomplish what you desire? Will it serve the needs of seniors if the home care agencies that remain are not as committed to serving all patients.<br/>So please reconsider the new payment options you are proposing and think about what type of agencies will be able to survive this upheaval. It may not be who you really want or need to meet the huge demand of care in the near future.<br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Drake R.

These changes would drastically weaken the interagency consultation provision of the Endangered Species Act -- widely considered the most important and effective provision of the Act -- and also undercut the Endangered Species Act's proper role in addressing the impacts of climate change on our nation's most imperiled wildlife. <br/><br/>For 35 years the Endangered Species Act has protected imperiled species from the effects of potentially harmful federal projects. The strength of the Endangered Species Act has been the checks and balances created by interagency consultation between federal agencies that build roads, issue logging permits, and lease oil and gas rights among other projects, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and National Marine Fisheries Services, whose primary responsibility is the conservation of endangered species. <br/><br/>Interagency consultation ensures that federal projects that may impact America's most imperiled wildlife are independently reviewed by federal wildlife experts and project modifications are made where necessary. In the overwhelming majority of consultations federal projects move forward with little or no significant changes.<br/><br/>The regulations you recently proposed would eliminate interagency consultation on thousands of federal projects that pose a risk to endangered and threatened species each year. The changes will almost certainly result in detrimental impacts on endangered and imperiled species and a higher propensity to overlook opportunities to avoid such impacts.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the fact that these are the most significant changes to regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act in more than 20 years, you have provided the public just 30 days in which to submit comments, not the traditional 90, and prevented anyone from sending their comments by email. <br/><br/>I request you set an additional 60 days to allow the public an opportunity to meaningfully comment on these proposed regulations.<br/><br/>I again strongly  urge you to not to finalize these regulatory changes. <br/><br/>Thank you.",,

FWS-R9-ES-2008-0093-55370,Comment on FR Doc # N/A,Center for Biological Diversity,"Dear U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Directors,<br/><br/>The most obvious problem with this Draft Environmental Assessment is that it doesn't consider certain information that is vital to properly and thoroughly analyzing the proposed action at hand: the proposed regulations changes to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.<br/><br/>The Draft Assessment unlawfully ignores global warming and climate change's profound impact on threatened and endangered species. Many species already listed as threatened or endangered are being affected by global climate change -- including, but certainly not limited to, the Sonoran pronghorn, piping plover, tidewater goby, grizzly bear, Quino checkerspot butterfly, desert tortoise, and Pitcher's thistle.<br/><br/>In this Draft Environmental Assessment, global warming information -- including recovery plans that explicitly mention global warming as threats -- is ignored entirely.  This purposeful blind eye is unquestionably unlawful given the main purpose of the Endangered Species Act: to recover listed species.<br/><br/>The alternatives in the draft document are illegally limited. It is evident from the proposed rule and the Draft Environmental Assessment that the agencies looked only at a preferred alternative of amending the well-established and largely successful Section 7 regulations.  The law requires you to take a hard look at the no-action alternative as well as other reasonable alternatives.  <br/><br/>The agencies must prepare a Draft EIS to better understand the environmental consequences of their action. The magnitude of federal agency involvement in the Endangered Species Act Section 7 process, and the agencies' own admission that their goal is to greatly reduce these consultations, by itself necessitates the issuance of a draft Environmental Impact Statement and fuller understanding of the impacts of this proposed rule.  <br/><br/>The consequences of this proposed rule would be massive, affecting over 1,000 listed species threatened with extinction, and hundreds of millions of acres of imperiled wildlife habitat.  The scope of this rule change cannot be overstated in very real practical terms.  <br/><br/>I ask that you extend the timeline for comments and issue an Environmental Impact Statement.<br/><br/>Thanks for your consideration.",,

I support the Department of Labor's decision to exclude construction from industry-recognized apprenticeship programs so that future generations of apprentices continue to receive excellent skills training.<br/><br/>If construction were included in the proposed industry-registered apprenticeship programs, it would allow greedy unscrupulous contractors to lower our standards, cut corners, and boost profits on the backs of their workers.

Blending ethanol at levels higher than 10% has been proven to harm many conventional engines. This could damage farm equipment and other commercial vehicles not to mention what it can do the many personal vehicles. Furthermore these ethanol fuel levels are meant to promote fuels such as E85 for which there is negligible demand.<br/><br/>The existing standard has already had the unintended consequence of raising the cost to agricultural businesses which rely on corn for feed, and I am concerned that the proposed standards may only continue to raise costs. <br/><br/>The Renewable Fuel Standard has been based on a number of flawed assumptions. At this point I believe the best course of action is for Congress to fix RFS legislatively. In the short term I ask that the EPA lower the ethanol blending requirements and to set the final ethanol level below 10 percent.<br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/> <br/>Colin Hastings<br/>Executive Director<br/>Pasco Chamber of Commerce",,

It will cause seriously ill individuals to lose desperately needed benefits, the vast majority of whom will not be able to replace the income from SSDI with earnings.  The large increase in disability reviews in this proposal will result in unwarranted denials.  <br/><br/>A similar approach was taken under the Reagan Administration, with such inhumane results that the policy was reversed after a public outcry when its harm became known.  The Reagan Administration terminated benefits of 315,000 people.  Nearly two-thirds of these denials were reversed.  Among those who lost benefits, 21,176 died.  <br/><br/>The Reagan Administration then and the current Administration now assume those denied will go to work, but studies, including research cited in the proposed rule itself, show that only a small minority will have even modest earnings.  At least two-thirds or more will not be able to work because their health impairments are severe.

Building on the historic progress of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, this rule proposes limiting added sugars in school meals for the very first time. School meals that are limited in added sugars and sodium and contain whole grains can help introduce healthy eating habits and can help mitigate chronic health conditions.  <br/><br/>Added Sugars: School breakfasts are far too sugary, and I applaud the USDA’s proposed cap of no more than 10 percent of calories from added sugars, which mirrors the Dietary Guidelines recommendation. I also support USDA’s product-specific added sugars limits.   <br/><br/>Sodium: While these sodium reduction goals represent progress, the final limits do not go far enough and are out of alignment with the Dietary Guidelines’ quantitative recommendations. For instance, children up to age 8 will get 83 percent of their daily recommended sodium limit from breakfast and lunch combined, leaving just 17 percent leftover for snacks and dinner. A 13-year-old will get 77 percent of their daily limit from school breakfast and lunch, and high school students will get 63 percent.  <br/><br/>Whole Grains: The two options proposed by the USDA require less than half of grains offered be whole, which is not aligned with the Dietary Guidelines’ recommendations. I encourage the USDA to strengthen the whole grain-rich requirement. <br/><br/>Healthy, wholesome meals provide children the nutrients they need to grow, develop and learn in and out of the classroom, and the 30 million kids who rely on school meals every day deserve better.

BOEM-2022-0048-13692,"Comment from Gold, W",None,"Dear Secretary Debra Haaland,<br/><br/>I am writing to you today to express my opposition to Gulf-wide leasing in the oil and gas lease sales 259 and 261. <br/><br/>The Inflation Reduction Act does not require the administration to lease the entire Western and Central Gulf. Nor does it mandate any particular results from those sales. Rather, Congress, through both the IRA and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, empowered Interior to determine the size, location, and conditions for offshore leasing sales and preserved Interior’s authority to decide whether to issue a lease. And BOEM has the obligation to make those decisions based on a full evaluation of the environmental effects that leasing will cause – including climate pollution, oil spills, and harms to the critically endangered Rice’s whale. <br/><br/>There is simply no need for BOEM to continue with the large-scale lease sales we saw for four years under the Trump administration. Oil companies currently hold close to 1,900 leases covering more than 10 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico. Only about 500 of those leases are currently in production, meeting the current demand for offshore oil and gas and leaving more than 7.4 million leased acres (or 75% of current lease holdings) remaining to be developed to meet any near or mid-term national energy needs. <br/><br/>Moreover, massive area-wide lease sales are fundamentally incompatible with the Biden administration’s commitments to fight climate change. Decisions we make now about additional leases have no effect on current or even near-term energy needs because new leases typically take a decade to produce any oil. And because of the long-term nature of oil and gas development, leasing now locks in investments in fossil fuels for decades to come, long after the time when the United States and the world must transition to a clean energy economy if we are to avoid the more catastrophic impacts of climate change.   <br/><br/>Finally, continuing with massive leases sales increases the already dire harm to Gulf wildlife – like the 50 remaining critically endangered Rice’s whale – and to Gulf communities, which have disproportionately borne the brunt of the country’s fossil fuel addiction for far too long. Locking in new leases means locking in continued harm for decades to come and will only slow the needed rapid phase-out of fossil fuel from the nation’s energy portfolio.   <br/><br/>I urge you to not sell off millions of acres of Gulf leases and to use your authority and ample discretion to instead accelerate the rapid transition to the clean energy future the country needs!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>W Gold<br/>Saugerties, NY 12477",,

The possible side effects in this case are NOT a lesser of two evils. ",,
FWS-HQ-ES-2025-0034-213546,"Comment from Quinn, Patricia",None,"I am writing to oppose your proposal to rescind the regulatory definition of “harm” under the Endangered Species Act. <br/><br/>Habitat destruction is the main driver of species decline. When Congress passed the Endangered Species Act, it explicitly recognized the importance of habitat in protecting and restoring endangered species. And the definition of harm you seek to delete was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court 30 years ago. If anything, the case for habitat protection under the ESA has grown even stronger since then, with mountains of scientific evidence linking habitat and species’ survival.   <br/><br/>There is no rational reason to rescind this definition; rescission only serves as an invitation to timber, oil, mining and other extractive industries, as well as the government and individuals, to try to destroy habitat that endangered species need to live, eat, and raise their young. Common sense, science, and the ESA itself tells us that habitat destruction harms species.  <br/><br/>Just one company or project can destroy habitat, but when a species disappears, we all suffer the consequences, which can include impacts to our food and water supply, to industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to tourism, and to our cultural and spiritual values.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Patricia Quinn<br/>Norfolk, VA",,
