HHS-OCR-2019-0007-118219,Comment on FR Doc # 2019-11512,American Civil Liberties Union,There's a reason why the Health Care Rights Law exists. Transgender and non-binary people are continuously denied medically necessary health care and harassed by medical providers. The same goes for people who seek reproductive care - including abortion care.  Making it harder for historically marginalized groups of people to access critical health care is an act of violence. I demand that you drop this proposed rule and withdraw it in its entirety.,,

HHS-OS-2018-0008-125954,Comment on FR Doc # 2018-11673,Susan B. Anthony List,"To My senators and congressmen and anyone else to whom it may concern :<br/><br/>Today I write in strong support of the proposed rule titled: Compliance With Statutory Program Integrity Requirements (HHS-OS-2018-0008), also known as the Protect Life Rule.<br/><br/>The proposed rule seeks to reinstate Reagan-era prohibitions on Title X funding for abortion centers. Similar regulations were upheld by the Supreme Court in 1991 in Rust v. Sullivan (500 U.S. 173).<br/><br/>Abortion is not family planning. This rule would draw a bright line between abortion and family planning, as was clearly intended in the statute.<br/><br/>Currently 266 Planned Parenthood abortion centers are also federal Title X locations. Planned Parenthood is the nations largest abortion business and receives $50-$60 million a year from Title X. They should not be entitled to treat Title X as their personal slush fund. Research released by the Charlotte Lozier Institute in 2018 shows Planned Parenthood has inflated the U.S. abortion rate, controlling more than 35% of the abortion industry and resulting in more than three million extra abortions that could have been avoided.<br/><br/>American taxpayers do not want to be complicit in abortions through their taxpayer dollars. According to a January 2018 Marist poll, six in ten Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion. Money is fungible and tax dollars should be invested in comprehensive health care alternatives, not used as a slush fund to prop up the abortion industry.<br/><br/>It's important to note that the proposed rule will not reduce family planning funding by a single dollar. This rule would simply direct taxpayer funds to family planning providers who stay out of the abortion business. Women and girls are best served at alternative health care centers including community and rural health care centers that outnumber Planned Parenthood abortion facilities by more than 20 to 1 nationwide.<br/><br/>I strongly urge adoption of the rule.<br/>  Life is not a joke. It is not something to take lightly. Life is precious . We must strive to protect It ! <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Ellen Concannon<br/>New Jersey",,

HHS-OCR-2019-0007-116102,Comment on FR Doc # 2019-11512,Susan B. Anthony List,"Dear Secretary Azar,<br/> <br/>I am writing in support of certain aspects of HHSOCR20190007, the proposed rule regarding section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. The proposed rule eliminates an Obama-era definition of ""discrimination on the basis of sex"" designed to force healthcare providers to participate in brutal abortions.  Instead the proposed rule clearly articulates longstanding laws protecting the rights of health care entities like doctors, nurses and hospitals to abstain from involvement in abortion. I support these changes.<br/> <br/>The current Obama-era regulations implementing section 1557 define ""discrimination on the basis of sex"" to include ""termination of pregnancy"" in a manner that goes far beyond the statutory authority provided to the Secretary.  For this reason the regulations was challenged in Franciscan Alliance v. Burwell and a district court issued a nationwide injunction against it.<br/> <br/>The proposed rules provide much needed clarity regarding the freedom of health care workers and facilities to practice medicine in accordance with their own judgement. Americans need and want access to quality healthcare providers.  A vast majority of health care providers do not engage in abortion.  At a time when our nation needs more, not less, healthcare workers and facilities, it is unconscionable to force them to carry out abortions or leave the medical field.<br/> <br/>This is a matter of access to healthcare. Abortion is not healthcare, rather it is the taking of a vulnerable life. We must ensure that healthcare providers allowed to continue providing life-affirming care to millions of Americans.  I support the provisions of the proposed rule eliminating the definition of ""discrimination on the basis of sex"" that includes ""termination of pregnancy"" and the application of longstanding protections for healthcare entities that refuse to participate in abortion.<br/> <br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Robyn Loughran<br/>Indiana",,

NOAA-NMFS-2009-0029-1976,"Comment from Linda Courtney, Center for Biological Diversity",Center for Biological Diversity,"I am writing to urge the National Marine Fisheries Service to immediately enforce the Marine Mammal Protection Act Section 101 by banning swordfish imports until exporting countries demonstrate that their swordfish catch meets U.S. standards for protecting marine mammals.  This 36-year-old law protects dozens of species of dolphins, porpoises, sea lions, whales, and other species I care about while safeguarding U.S. fishers from unfair competition with unregulated foreign fishing fleets.  The time is long overdue to enforce the law and ban swordfish imports.<br/><br/>Congress recognized that fishing posed a threat to marine mammal species when it passed this provision of the Marine Mammal Protection Act over 30 years ago.  Enforcement of Marine Mammal Protection Act provisions for U.S. fisheries has led to the establishment of significant protective measures aimed at restricting harmful fishing practices and protecting marine mammal populations from unsustainable fisheries bycatch.  Congress also recognized that, if the United States' efforts to protect marine mammals from fisheries bycatch were to be successful, it would have to exert pressure on fisheries of other nations to adopt similarly protective measures.<br/><br/>The Marine Mammal Protection Act requires that all fisheries meet a ""zero mortality rate goal"" - in other words, that they reduce incidental death and serious injury of marine mammals to as close to zero as possible. This requirement has led to a number of important regulations on U.S. fishing, including gear-based requirements such as the use of pingers and net extenders, limits on the length of longlines, and as other measures like time-area closures, safe handling and release training and equipment, and mandatory observer coverage. All of these measures play a vital role in reducing fisheries' impact on populations of marine mammals and other species.<br/><br/>Banning swordfish imports until source countries demonstrate that they meet these important standards would use U.S. market power to protect marine species I care about around the world and protect the economic interests of domestic fisheries. Therefore, I strongly urge the National Marine Fisheries Service to implement the ban immediately. Thank you for your attention to this important issue.",,

FWS-R9-ES-2008-0093-20656,Comment on FR Doc # E8-18938,Center for Biological Diversity,"I am writing to urge you to stop the changes to longstanding regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act you recently proposed. These changes would drastically weaken the interagency consultation provision of the Endangered Species Act -- widely considered the most important and effective provision of the Act -- and also undercut the Endangered Species Act's proper role in addressing the impacts of climate change on our nation's most imperiled wildlife. <br/><br/>For 35 years the Endangered Species Act has protected imperiled species from the effects of potentially harmful federal projects. The strength of the Endangered Species Act has been the checks and balances created by interagency consultation between federal agencies that build roads, issue logging permits, and lease oil and gas rights among other projects, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and National Marine Fisheries Services, whose primary responsibility is the conservation of endangered species. <br/><br/>Interagency consultation ensures that federal projects that may impact America's most imperiled wildlife are independently reviewed by federal wildlife experts and project modifications are made where necessary. In the overwhelming majority of consultations federal projects move forward with little or no significant changes.<br/><br/>The regulations you recently proposed would eliminate interagency consultation on thousands of federal projects that pose a risk to endangered and threatened species each year. The changes will almost certainly result in detrimental impacts on endangered and imperiled species and a higher propensity to overlook opportunities to avoid such impacts.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the fact that these are the most significant changes to regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act in more than 20 years, you have provided the public just 30 days in which to submit comments, not the traditional 90, and prevented anyone from sending their comments by email. <br/><br/>I request you set an additional 60 days to allow the public an opportunity to meaningfully comment on these proposed regulations.<br/><br/>I also urge you to not to finalize these regulatory changes. <br/><br/>Thank you.",,
FWS-HQ-ES-2020-0102-6128,Submitted Electronically via eRulemaking Portal,None,"We need to be managing our forests.<br/><br/>As a supporter of the Ruffed Grouse Society and American Woodcock Society, I respectfully submit this public comment in support of the proposed rule guiding Interagency Consultation for existing forest and land-management plans. I support the need to protect threatened and endangered species, but when existing, approved Forest Plans have identified and taken into account these wildlife needs, species-specific concerns and analysis of potential impacts of specific actions should be addressed at the forest project level. <br/><br/>This rule clarifies that consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service is not required of federal agencies a programmatic (forest or land-management plan) level when new information becomes available, new critical habitat is designated, or a new species is listed for a project that is taking place within the guidelines of the plan. Consultation requirements for proposed projects within the plan remain in place. Potential impacts to listed species, species-specific concerns and analysis of specific actions are most appropriately addressed at the project level.<br/><br/>The lack of clarity on this consultation process is resulting in unnecessary litigation that drains time and resources we can ill afford to lose. While populations of ruffed grouse, American woodcock, and other forest wildlife face serious declines, more than 80 million acres of national forest land are in critical need of attention to restore environmental function and provide quality habitat.

BLS-2024-0001-23968,Comment on FR Doc # 2024-12825,American Society of Radiologic Technologists,"As a member of the American Society of Radiologic Technologists, I respectfully submit public comment to the Office of Management and Budget to consider updating the classification of diagnostic radiologic technologists to professional under 29-2030.  <br/><br/>Radiologic technologists work at the intersection of innovation in medical technology and direct patient care. This requires us to exercise critical thinking daily, not only as part of a larger health care delivery team but also individually when deciding how best to provide care based on each patient’s particular needs. <br/><br/>Radiologic technologists are similar in a broad sense to a variety of other health care workers who are required to exercise critical thinking and independent judgment as part of their daily jobs. The job of the radiologic technologist involves operating imaging equipment to capture images of a patient’s internal body structures and troubleshooting systems to ensure diagnostic-quality images. They collaborate with radiologists, ensuring that diagnostic-quality images are captured through the appropriate imaging modality. For example, a technologist must use certain imaging techniques for a trauma patient to assure safe imaging and accurate diagnosis.  Capturing elbow images that allow for diagnosis on a patient who walks in is quite different than capturing images for a patient with significant trauma. Radiologic technologists work autonomously to use their knowledge, tools and critical thinking skills to capture diagnostic images. If images are not diagnostic, the radiologist may miss a diagnosis. Radiologic technologists must enforce strict radiation protocols throughout their work, and they have a critical role in patient care: providing instructions to patients and ensuring patients are comfortable and safe during procedures.   <br/><br/>The role of the radiologic technologist in the modern health care industry continues to evolve as the demand for improved imaging technology accelerates. This has made radiologic technologists more essential and has required more specialization. Therefore, I believe it appropriate that the SOC occupational definition for radiologic technologists be reconsidered to more accurately reflect the increasingly professional responsibilities of this occupation. Additionally, technologists’ therapy counterparts, radiation therapists, are already classified as professionals, and they ensure a similar level of patient management and critical thinking as radiologic technologists every day. <br/><br/>I urge the OMB to take this opportunity to revise the SOC occupational definitions to provide important updates to the radiologic technologist definition that reflect the growing importance of the profession. I urge the OMB to update definition to more clearly designates the radiologic technologist as a professional. This would more accurately reflect the actual practice of this vital health care role and ensure that this profession is properly characterized. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to present these comments for the OMB’s possible revision of the SOC for 2028.",,
