WHD-2017-0003-108441,"Syen, Helen",None," ,<br/><br/>I oppose the proposed rule (RIN: 1235-AA21). It would go against decades of federal and state law and precedent safeguarding tips as the property of the workers who receive them, by allowing employers to take control of their employees tips. <br/><br/>The Fair Labor Standards Act was amended in 1974 to clarify that tips are to be retained by the employee except when a valid tip pooling arrangement is in place. <br/><br/>In 2011, the DOL issued new regulations to reinforce the FLSA and over 40 years of custom and practice by the DOL and state agencies, affirming that tips are always the property of the employee (29 C.F.R.  531.52).<br/><br/>If adopted, this regulation would force a vulnerable workforce further into poverty, economic instability, and vulnerability to harassment and assault. <br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to withdraw this proposed rule.<br/><br/>Helen Syen<br/>shhhhhsilenceisgolden@gmail.com<br/>2542 Faunce St<br/>Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19152",,
