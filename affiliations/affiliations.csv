FWS-R6-ES-2024-0186-2243,"Comment from Riedthaler, Janette",None,"Thank you for denying state petitions that would have removed federal protection from grizzly bears. I’m relieved that grizzlies remain safe from aggressive state management policies. <br/><br/>However, I’m concerned about the proposed rules that would give state agencies and individuals more leeway to kill grizzlies. I’m especially worried about giving individuals permission to kill these bears to protect livestock, including potentially by granting permits to kill grizzlies on public lands. <br/><br/>I also urge you to keep grizzly protections in place within recovery zones and connectivity corridors, as these lands are essential to the great bears’ recovery. <br/><br/>Finally, I oppose any rule that would permit hunting of grizzly bears.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Janette Riedthaler<br/>OH 44119",
DOT-OST-1995-321-0049,National MRO Inc. - Comment,National MRO,Comments of National MRO Inc.,"National MRO (NMRO) supports the DOT’s proposed 4 hour/40 ounce rule and physician evaluation procedures, recommends a 5-day waiting period instead of 30 for unresolved positive tests, and agrees with “non-contact positive” language. NMRO urges maintaining strong conflict of interest prohibitions between laboratories and MROs, arguing laboratories should not act as Third Party Administrators (TPAs) or consolidate billing, while MROs/TPAs should remain independent and manage multiple labs. NMRO finds DOT guidance on consortia/TPAs unclear, objects to labs as TPAs, and emphasizes that confidentiality and recordkeeping are better handled by MRO organizations. NMRO also suggests negative alcohol test results can be sent to TPAs and recommends BAT form redesign."
USTR-2019-0003-0926,"Comment from Kaitlin Myers, Whole Foods market ",Whole Foods market,"Please do not allow the proposed tariffs on European goods to pass. The effects on the American specialty foods industry could be catastrophic and puts the livelihoods of many cheese professionals at risk. The tariffs in question could increase the price of imported European cheese by 100%. The tariffs are intended to punish the European Union, but it directly impacts small food businesses in the U.S.<br/><br/>Cheese retailers operate on very thin margins with highly perishable products. They will have to raise their prices. Fewer people will be able to afford the cheeses, and some people might even go out of business. These tariffs are set to be put in effect this fall and will directly affect the bottom line of retailers just before their busiest, most profitable holiday season. This can even affect domestic cheeses because if less cheese is sold overall, the costs of distribution and shipping can go up for everyone.<br/><br/>If the supposed goal of the tariffs is to stimulate the American aviation businesses, it makes no sense to pursue that goal by impairing the economic livelihood of other American businesses and consumers. Please dont let an argument between aircraft carriers affect the livelihoods of business owners all over this great nation.",
CMS-2012-0031-53390,FORM 12,None,"The Administration's ""advance notice"" does not correct the fundamental problems in its contraceptive mandate.<br/><br/>Both the coercive mandate itself, and its extremely narrow exemption for ""religious employers,"" remain unchanged. Almost all private health plans, even those sponsored by many religious organizations, will be required to pay for or facilitate coverage for sterilization and all FDA-approved ""contraceptives,"" including drugs that can cause abortion.  This coverage will be provided ""automatically"" to employees and their dependents, including minors, whether the employees want the coverage or not. Employers will have no right to act on their values when they provide health coverage. Employees, and those who provide or purchase health insurance outside the employer context, will have no freedom to opt out.  <br/><br/>I urge you to allow all organizations and individuals to offer, sponsor and obtain health coverage that does not violate their moral and religious convictions.",
VA-2016-VHA-0011-3658,AP44-Proposed Rule-Comment Submitter,None,"I support America's veterans: they put their lives on the line in service to our country, and I believe they deserve the best possible medical care. I oppose any mandate that would force the best trained physicians out of the operating room. I urge the VA to preserve physician-led, team-based surgical anesthesia care.",
