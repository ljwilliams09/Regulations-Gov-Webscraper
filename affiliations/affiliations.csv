OSHA-2021-0009-6109,"Comment from Alder, John; Private Citizen",Private Citizen,"I am writing to support the proposed OSHA rule to protect non-residential indoor and outdoor workers from the hazards of working when the temperature soars.  We are in the hottest summer on record. My family members, co-workers, and I face hotter and hotter temperatures at work, which climb each year.  Death and illness from exposure to heat is preventable, yet employers have not been required to provide water, shade, rest breaks, or even training to protect workers.  It’s a matter of life and death; common sense health and safety standards should not be optional.<br/><br/>We need to protect the more than 36 million workers, disproportionately Black and Brown, who are impacted by exposure to extreme temperatures at work, including but not limited to:<br/><br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Airport workers on the blazing tarmac or cleaning stifling cabins,<br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Janitors cleaning office buildings after the AC is turned off,<br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Restaurant workers in hot kitchens, <br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Commercial laundry workers toiling in very hot, humid conditions,  <br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Construction and farm workers whose duties keep them outdoors regardless of temperature, <br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Healthcare workers treating increasing heat illness emergencies.<br/> <br/>The federal rule that OSHA proposes is a significant first step in protecting indoor and outdoor workers – training, rest breaks, shade, and water.  I encourage you to resist efforts to weaken or compromise on the proposed standards.  I urge you to ensure that the final rule applies to ALL workers facing unsafe temperatures in their work environment.  I urge you to act boldly and swiftly to implement the strongest possible heat standards- which will go a long way to protecting workers and saving lives.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>John Alder<br/>Spokane, WA",,

FWS-R6-ES-2024-0186-20781,"Comment from Hoppe, Richard",None,"I unequivocally support continuing threatened species status under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for grizzly bears. Their low numbers and the growing threats to their habitat and continued existence warrants ESA protections.<br/> <br/>I support the USFWS’ decision to essentially continue to protect grizzlies as a single distinct population segment (DPS) and to abandon the current approach that treats each population as distinct from the rest. Population geneticists tell us that to maintain a viable population for the long term there needs to be a population of at least 5,000 bears in the Northern Rockies. That will only happen with an interconnected population that includes all of the current core populations, a robust population in the Greater Salmon-Selway-Bitterroot region, and all of the suitable habitat surrounding and between these populations. I support the proposed rule’s focus on natural connectivity between the core populations and between those areas and the Selway-Bitterroot ecosystem.<br/> <br/>However, the DPS leaves out other potential areas that are connected to the Northern Rockies, including the Greater Hells Canyon region and the High Uintas ecosystem. Grizzlies are known to have been in very close proximity to both regions, and with protection and tolerance we can expect grizzlies to take up residence within the next 50 years.<br/> <br/>I oppose stripping ESA protected status from grizzlies that explore beyond the proposed DPS. Any grizzly bear, regardless of where it is found, deserves full protection of the ESA.<br/> <br/>Under any conditions, I oppose a trophy hunting season for grizzly bears.<br/> <br/>I also strongly urge the USFWS to drop its proposed 4(d) rule. Way too many grizzlies are already needlessly dying at the hands of humans. Relaxing the rules for killing them is going in exactly the wrong direction. Specifically on public lands, no grizzlies should be killed for preying on livestock. On private lands, no bears should be killed for preying on livestock unless all reasonable non-lethal measures have been deployed. There are places like the Blackfoot drainage in Montana where ranchers and other private landowners have shown we can co-exist with bears. Those lessons need to be deployed widely, but the proposed rule instead encourages less tolerance.<br/> <br/>Also, no serious assessment of future threats to bears can ignore the impacts from recreation. There is mounting evidence showing that recreationists are displacing bears from preferred habitats, even in remote Wilderness and national parks. The proposed rule ignores this extremely significant threat, and that needs to change.<br/> <br/>Finally, I hope that the proposed rule will be seen as an opportunity for the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee to change its tunnel-vision focus on trying to prematurely delist grizzly bears to focusing instead on what needs to be done to ensure the Great Bear will find a suitable and welcoming home as it reinhabits—on its own time and its own way—the entirety of the Northern Rockies ecosystem.",,

I’m relieved that grizzlies remain safe from aggressive state management policies. <br/><br/>However, I’m concerned about the proposed rules that would give state agencies and individuals more leeway to kill grizzlies.

FWS-HQ-ES-2025-0034-120983,"Comment from MURRAY, MELISSA",None,"I strongly object to your proposal to redefine “harm” in the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to exclude consideration of impacts on the habitat of listed species. <br/><br/>This proposal ignores common sense and established science showing that animals are completely interconnected with the lands and waters they call home and that provide shelter, food, and mates necessary for survival. It also goes against growing evidence that habitat loss is the leading cause of biodiversity decline—exactly what the ESA is supposed to help prevent.<br/><br/>Importantly, the proposal contradicts the intent of Congress and the rule of law. Congress included “habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife” in the definition of “harm” when it enacted the ESA over 50 years ago. This definition has been upheld by the Supreme Court and is currently the law that federal agencies are required to follow. <br/> <br/>Removing habitat considerations from the definition of “harm” in the ESA would be like someone breaking into or burning down your house but then claiming innocence because you didn’t immediately die in the process. Forests, prairies, rivers, and other wild places are essential to survival of wildlife. Your agencies are mandated to protect endangered and threatened species—not to give drilling, mining, logging, and other companies a green light to destroy their habitat.<br/><br/>Please do not move forward with your proposal to redefine “harm” in the ESA.

FDA-2014-N-0189-71089,Comment from Anonymous,None,"  I am a vaper.  I am so HAPPY to make that statement.  From the time I was 14 (I am 33, now.) until about 6 months ago, I was a smoker.  I started smoking in high school, and only smoked occasionally.  Over the course of the many years I smoked, I became a pack and a half  to two pack a day smoker.  I have two children, and allergies, and decided that it was time to do what was right for myself and my children, and give up cigarettes.  I had tried many, many times to quit in the past.  I had tried cold turkey, candy, nicotine gum - all with no success.  I tried cig-a-likes a couple of years ago, and had limited success.  About 6 moths ago, my fiance and I both bought tank/battery mods for vaping.  We have not smoked since we bought them.  For me, e-cigs have offered the best possible method for quitting. I still get the nicotine, which I have already stepped down from 18mg concentration to 12mg in the short time I have been vaping.  I still get the ""action"" of smoking - that comforting hand to mouth motion that I have become so accustomed to over the past nearly 20 years.  The best part about e-cigs, though, is the flavor choices.  Being able to steer away from traditional tobacco flavor to sweet, fruity, and minty flavors has made it impossible to want to go back to the ashtray mouth taste of combustible tobacco.  If it weren't for the wide variety of flavors, I honestly do not believe I would have the success I am having with e-cigarettes.  The ability to control my vaping experience through adjustable wattage/voltage, air-flow regulators, tank sizes and battery sizes is also a huge bonus.  As a result of switching to vaping, I have had fewer sinus problems, fewer upper respiratory complaints, and fewer sore throats.  I am breathing better.  My clothes and home no longer smell like smoke.  Most importantly, my children no longer smell like smoke.  They don't cough like they used to when I (and/or my fiance) smoked.  My five-year-old daughter no longer complains about the smell.  (My son is only just shy of a year.  He is not able to complain.)  Our whole family is SO much better off, because vaping was a viable option for my fiance and me.  I am not a scientist, so I can't give you specific information on chemicals or hardware functions.  All I can do is tell you my story.  I was a smoker for almost 20 years, and I have made a successful harm-reduction choice that is changing my life.  I plan to further step down my nicotine levels, until I am at 0 nicotine and can eventually quit.  I am SO thankful that e-cigarettes and flavored e-liquids exist.  I realize there is a need to regulate the legal age for purchasing these products, but I feel that harsh regulations that make it impossible for me to access the kind of hardware and liquids I have been using will have a severely negative impact on the progress I have made in my journey to quit smoking.  <br/>Thank you for taking the time to read my comment.",,
