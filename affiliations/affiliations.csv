OSHA-2021-0009-6109,"Comment from Alder, John; Private Citizen",Private Citizen,"I am writing to support the proposed OSHA rule to protect non-residential indoor and outdoor workers from the hazards of working when the temperature soars.  We are in the hottest summer on record. My family members, co-workers, and I face hotter and hotter temperatures at work, which climb each year.  Death and illness from exposure to heat is preventable, yet employers have not been required to provide water, shade, rest breaks, or even training to protect workers.  It’s a matter of life and death; common sense health and safety standards should not be optional.<br/><br/>We need to protect the more than 36 million workers, disproportionately Black and Brown, who are impacted by exposure to extreme temperatures at work, including but not limited to:<br/><br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Airport workers on the blazing tarmac or cleaning stifling cabins,<br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Janitors cleaning office buildings after the AC is turned off,<br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Restaurant workers in hot kitchens, <br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Commercial laundry workers toiling in very hot, humid conditions,  <br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Construction and farm workers whose duties keep them outdoors regardless of temperature, <br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Healthcare workers treating increasing heat illness emergencies.<br/> <br/>The federal rule that OSHA proposes is a significant first step in protecting indoor and outdoor workers – training, rest breaks, shade, and water.  I encourage you to resist efforts to weaken or compromise on the proposed standards.

FWS-R6-ES-2024-0186-20781,"Comment from Hoppe, Richard",None,"I unequivocally support continuing threatened species status under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for grizzly bears. Their low numbers and the growing threats to their habitat and continued existence warrants ESA protections.<br/> <br/>I support the USFWS’ decision to essentially continue to protect grizzlies as a single distinct population segment (DPS) and to abandon the current approach that treats each population as distinct from the rest. Population geneticists tell us that to maintain a viable population for the long term there needs to be a population of at least 5,000 bears in the Northern Rockies. That will only happen with an interconnected population that includes all of the current core populations, a robust population in the Greater Salmon-Selway-Bitterroot region, and all of the suitable habitat surrounding and between these populations. I support the proposed rule’s focus on natural connectivity between the core populations and between those areas and the Selway-Bitterroot ecosystem.<br/> <br/>However, the DPS leaves out other potential areas that are connected to the Northern Rockies, including the Greater Hells Canyon region and the High Uintas ecosystem. Grizzlies are known to have been in very close proximity to both regions, and with protection and tolerance we can expect grizzlies to take up residence within the next 50 years.<br/> <br/>I oppose stripping ESA protected status from grizzlies that explore beyond the proposed DPS. Any grizzly bear, regardless of where it is found, deserves full protection of the ESA.<br/> <br/>Under any conditions, I oppose a trophy hunting season for grizzly bears.<br/> <br/>I also strongly urge the USFWS to drop its proposed 4(d) rule. Way too many grizzlies are already needlessly dying at the hands of humans. Relaxing the rules for killing them is going in exactly the wrong direction. Specifically on public lands, no grizzlies should be killed for preying on livestock. On private lands, no bears should be killed for preying on livestock unless all reasonable non-lethal measures have been deployed. There are places like the Blackfoot drainage in Montana where ranchers and other private landowners have shown we can co-exist with bears. Those lessons need to be deployed widely, but the proposed rule instead encourages less tolerance.<br/> <br/>Also, no serious assessment of future threats to bears can ignore the impacts from recreation. There is mounting evidence showing that recreationists are displacing bears from preferred habitats, even in remote Wilderness and national parks. The proposed rule ignores this extremely significant threat, and that needs to change.<br/> <br/>Finally, I hope that the proposed rule will be seen as an opportunity for the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee to change its tunnel-vision focus on trying to prematurely delist grizzly bears to focusing instead on what needs to be done to ensure the Great Bear will find a suitable and welcoming home as it reinhabits—on its own time and its own way—the entirety of the Northern Rockies ecosystem.",,

FDA-2014-N-0189-71089,Comment from Anonymous,None,"  I am a vaper.  I am so HAPPY to make that statement.  From the time I was 14 (I am 33, now.) until about 6 months ago, I was a smoker.  I started smoking in high school, and only smoked occasionally.  Over the course of the many years I smoked, I became a pack and a half  to two pack a day smoker.  I have two children, and allergies, and decided that it was time to do what was right for myself and my children, and give up cigarettes.  I had tried many, many times to quit in the past.  I had tried cold turkey, candy, nicotine gum - all with no success.  I tried cig-a-likes a couple of years ago, and had limited success.  About 6 moths ago, my fiance and I both bought tank/battery mods for vaping.  We have not smoked since we bought them.  For me, e-cigs have offered the best possible method for quitting. I still get the nicotine, which I have already stepped down from 18mg concentration to 12mg in the short time I have been vaping.  I still get the ""action"" of smoking - that comforting hand to mouth motion that I have become so accustomed to over the past nearly 20 years.  The best part about e-cigs, though, is the flavor choices.  Being able to steer away from traditional tobacco flavor to sweet, fruity, and minty flavors has made it impossible to want to go back to the ashtray mouth taste of combustible tobacco.  If it weren't for the wide variety of flavors, I honestly do not believe I would have the success I am having with e-cigarettes.  The ability to control my vaping experience through adjustable wattage/voltage, air-flow regulators, tank sizes and battery sizes is also a huge bonus.  As a result of switching to vaping, I have had fewer sinus problems, fewer upper respiratory complaints, and fewer sore throats.  I am breathing better.  My clothes and home no longer smell like smoke.  Most importantly, my children no longer smell like smoke.  They don't cough like they used to when I (and/or my fiance) smoked.  My five-year-old daughter no longer complains about the smell.  (My son is only just shy of a year.  He is not able to complain.)  Our whole family is SO much better off, because vaping was a viable option for my fiance and me.  I am not a scientist, so I can't give you specific information on chemicals or hardware functions.  All I can do is tell you my story.  I was a smoker for almost 20 years, and I have made a successful harm-reduction choice that is changing my life.  I plan to further step down my nicotine levels, until I am at 0 nicotine and can eventually quit.  I am SO thankful that e-cigarettes and flavored e-liquids exist.  I realize there is a need to regulate the legal age for purchasing these products, but I feel that harsh regulations that make it impossible for me to access the kind of hardware and liquids I have been using will have a severely negative impact on the progress I have made in my journey to quit smoking.  <br/>Thank you for taking the time to read my comment.",,

I urge you to keep the national Roadless Rule intact and current protections in place for roadless areas in Alaska. <br/><br/>The Roadless Rule is one of the smartest and most popular land management policies the federal government has ever adopted. Not only does it preserve some of Americas best fish and wildlife habitat, but it also saves untold millions of taxpayer dollars that might otherwise be spent to subsidize money-losing timber sales.<br/><br/>The value of the Roadless Rule in preventing environmentally damaging and economically wasteful road-building and logging is particularly important in the Tongass, where logging costs vastly exceed timber revenues and require unconscionable taxpayer subsidies. <br/><br/>It is vital that the Forest Service disclose the economics of timber harvest on the Tongass, the cost of associated road-building, and the loss to taxpayers in the environmental analysis for this proposal.

IRS-2023-0041-26491,"Comment from Medeiros , Jodie ",None,"I am writing to express my concerns regarding the recent rules on reportable transactions. While I understand the need for transparency and the pursuit of tax cheats, I believe there are certain aspects that require further consideration.<br/><br/>Firstly, the inclusion of stablecoin transactions in the reporting requirements raises questions about the practicality and necessity of such a measure. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, and their usage is widespread among average consumers. Reporting every stablecoin transaction may result in an overwhelming amount of data that could hinder the IRS's ability to effectively identify and pursue tax evasion.<br/><br/>Secondly, the issue of privacy is of utmost importance. Requiring the reporting of every digital asset transaction, including those on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, may infringe upon individuals' privacy rights. It is crucial to strike a balance between transparency and privacy to ensure that law-abiding citizens are not unduly burdened.<br/><br/>Lastly, the enforcement of these reporting requirements on DeFi platforms presents a unique challenge. DeFi operates in a decentralized manner, making it difficult to track and regulate transactions. Imposing stringent reporting obligations on these platforms may hinder innovation and discourage participation in this emerging sector.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while I appreciate the IRS's efforts to combat tax evasion, I believe it is essential to carefully consider the implications of the rules on stablecoin transactions, privacy, and the decentralized nature of DeFi. Finding a balanced approach that promotes transparency without unduly burdening taxpayers is crucial.",,

FDA-2021-N-1309-9321,"Comment from Ali, Abdullah",Tobacco retailer,"I am writing as a responsible tobacco retailer in Georgia to oppose the proposed ban on licensed retailers selling flavored cigars to adults 21 and older.  I am proud of the work we do every day to make sure tobacco products are sold only to adults 21 and older.  Please do not move forward with this unfair proposal that could harm tobacco retailers across the United States by shifting many of these products to illegal sellers that don't care who they sell to or how they do it.<br/><br/>If implemented, this proposal could hurt retailers and wholesalers in the U.S. and directly impact my bottom line.  This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue.  An estimated 37% to 47% of popular price large cigars are flavored, generating $4 to 5 billion in nationwide annual retail sales. Additionally, adult customers who purchase flavored cigars also purchase gas, food, and other items that my store depends on.<br/><br/>It makes no sense to end the sale of these products through licensed retail stores like mine.  Bans could shift sales to illegal markets where many consumers can still get them, but without any regulatory protection or underage prevention. Flavor bans create illegal markets that could endanger the public with bootleg products, cause tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access, crime, arrests, and community conflict.<br/><br/>Underage use of cigars is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21---not with bans that create illegal markets.  Responsible, licensed retailers like me have worked hard to comply with age-verification requirements, and these efforts are a big reason why underage rates have fallen so low.<br/><br/>I respectfully urge you to reconsider a ban on flavored cigars, and instead focus on more positive solutions that respect the role of responsible, legal businesses like mine.  Instead of banning products for adults, the government should be giving adult smokers more information and choices for lower risk tobacco products -- as well as continuing to focus on underage prevention and education.<br/>",,
OSHA-2007-0073-3213,"Comment from Rebman, Michael; Private Citizen",Private Citizen,"I am writing to object to the proposed OSHA regulations for fire brigades as written. I am currently employed by both a volunteer service and a combination fire department, in Wisconsin a state, that is like most states in this country, supported by primarily volunteer fire services. With these proposed changes to the regulations, these volunteers and communities that these volunteers support stand to lose everything with the imposed and mandatory changes that OSHA is purposing. <br/><br/>My biggest concerns lie in the following categories:<br/><br/>-OSHA's Role in the Fire industry<br/><br/>While OSHA has historically provided oversight over the fire industry (specifically industrial fire departments) I feel that with this purposed change OSHA is taking too large of a step to control an industry that is inherently dangerous. With these changes there is a huge potential to decrease eligible members to fight fire and provide EMS services, inadvertently increasing risk to those that are eligible to provide the necessary services. In addition, OSHA's lack of understanding of current NFPA's current and future standards should not go unmentioned. NFPA standards are and have been created by industry experts, and are continuously being updated as the industry, technology, and tactics change. With OSHA’s reference to outdated NFPA standards it’s clear that OSHA is not and will not stay up  to date with the latest and greatest  in the industry. <br/><br/>-Training<br/><br/>As a volunteer organization we are already training extensively. However, I fear that more stringent training might force our older members to lose interest in the thing that some charter members created. In addition, it has been said that these older/charter members would be forced to go through training that meets NFPA requirements and would no longer be grandfathered in because of their experience and previous courses that they have taken. This example of disregard for past training further increases the risk that qualified individuals take when providing services.  Another proposal is that all chief officers must have Officer III this class is not offered in many states and in addition if offered comes at a substantial price. This price is so significant that many volunteer departments might not have the funding for. <br/><br/>Overall, the impact that this purposed change will enact is far surmountable for many volunteer and career departments. Many of these department’s budgets cannot support the budgetary increases that are being purposed with all the measures OSHA plans to take. I have only highlighted two of the many issues that are in the purposed fire brigade changes. Please reconsider and listen to the voices of constituents opposing the purposed rule changes and think about the volunteers. Afterall, it is these volunteers that provide the majority of fire and EMS support to our nation. <br/><br/>Respectfully, <br/>Michael Rebman <br/>",,

Specifically I'd like to comment on three of the performance measures in this rule. <br/><br/>National Highway System (NHS) Performance<br/>In the FAST Act, Congress made clear that states must consider all modes and users in the building and reconstruction of NHS projects. However, this rule proposes to measure reliability of the system by travel time for motor vehicles ONLY.<br/><br/>The reliability of the NHS must include a measure for ALL users. For bicyclists and pedestrians reliability should be measured by safe access on NHS roads. <br/><br/>Congestion Mitigation<br/>The rule proposes that congestion mitigation be measured by delay for drivers. It fails to measure people not adding to that congestion because they are biking, walking or taking transit. <br/><br/>Many states and metropolitan areas have goals to reduce congestion by reducing vehicle miles traveled and/or to increase mode share for bicycling, walking and transit use. To make this rule more compatible with these goals, a new measure should be added to account for people traveling by modes that reduce congestion: transit, bicycling and walking.<br/><br/>Mobile Source Emissions<br/>I support the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions both from tailpipes and from construction of new projects. The transportation system is responsible for 23 percent of the country's emissions, and in order to meet the goals and commitments made at the Paris COP we need to start measuring and reducing emissions.<br/><br/>I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the rule, and support the move to a performance-based transportation system.<br/><br/>I hope the final performance measures will reflect the Secretary's leadership to serve all users of the transportation system.",,

Several years ago, my geneticist told me my current symptoms were from cervical spinal instability. He and and his surgeon told me I would become totally paralyzed, stroke out, or die without a C1,2 fusion. We were terrified and I had the surgery. I later found out some of the stuff he put into my neck, Bmp2, could likely cause cancer, choking, extreme pain, excessive bone growth. Ironically I found out the same week I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. My pain has steadily increased. I do have excessive bone growth and the new specialist, an EDS neurosurgeon says I need complicated surgery to keep my spinal cord from being squeezed to death.<br/>The pain of all these conditions is Relentless. My neck feels like there are long razor blades imbedded into the back of my neck and strapped tightly into my neck with no relief. The IH causes horrific pressure on my brain, like my brain has a brick squeezed in between my brain and skull. I cannot lay my head on a pillow without having to do breathing techniques and distractions to get my mind off the pressure and pain. It is constant. My spine has several herniated discs so I have wxtreme burning pain in several areas of my spine.

Now, with the combination of effective medications, and IV infusions for Fabry disease, she is attending university several hours away.<br/>My husband works long hours in a factory. He only gets a few weeks per year for vacation. He cannot take time off for all the dr appts; so we are limited who we can see. The pain was interfering with my life so much, it was hard to get out of bed. Often I cannot hold my head up due to pain. Thankfully, I found a pain management dr who understands these conditions are legitimate and my pain is real and debilitating. I can not work any longer due to the pain etc. I had gone through job retraining to try to find a way to work in spite of my pain. The Dr then left and another has replaced him. He too is a good dr. He is very concerned with making sure he follows all the rules and restrictions the government keeps imposing. He does a great job of helping his patients and abiding with the law quidelines.<br/>But- with the govt making more and more rules in an effort to stop the abuse of opiod medications and other controlled substances, it is creating MORE and worse problems. People are not able to find drs to help with their pain. Or if they do, the drs will only prescribe the bare minimum which in many cases is not enough to enable patients to get out of bed and function. Then depression can set in. There are people in the EDS, IH, and CSF communities who committed suicide because their pain was not deal with. The pain was too much.<br/>I am alive today because drs are able to precribe me pain medications. I take them ""as directed"". I do not take more, I do not look for them on the streets and I do not add alcohol to the mix. I need pain medicine to knock the pain back enough so I can help my daughter pack for college. So I can go shopping for an hour to buy groceries. I need medicine so I can cook supper for my husband. I need this medicine so I can speak easily on the phone to my son who now lives 9 hrs away. <br/>I am not trying to go sky diving, climb mountains.  I have changed careers to work as long as possible. I can't work any more.<br/>I need the pain medicines to knock my pain down enough so I can GET UP and do a few things to help my family. I love them. I want to be here.for them. I need the medicine to LIVE.<br/>",,

I am opposed to the Agency's flawed policy that a bachelor's degree in nursing is equivalent to a bachelor's degree in the biological sciences, as well as its proposal to list nursing ""as a separate qualifying degree...for purposes of meeting the educational requirements for moderate and high complexity testing personnel and technical consultants.""<br/><br/>A bachelor's degree in nursing is NOT equivalent to a biological sciences degree, and it does not provide academic instruction sufficient to perform or supervise non-waived laboratory testing. A biological sciences degree may require 60 semester hours or more of biological and chemical sciences-much of it upper level-whereas a nursing degree typically requires fewer than 15 semester hours of biological and or chemical science-most of which tends to be introductory/survey level. As a degree, it is insufficient to provide the necessary scientific knowledge and training in non-waived laboratory procedures. <br/><br/>Unless a bachelor's degree is substantially equivalent in terms of its course load and level and related laboratory training/experience, it should not allow its holder to perform high complexity testing or supervise non-waived laboratory testing.

Building on the historic progress of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, this rule proposes limiting added sugars in school meals for the very first time. School meals that are limited in added sugars and sodium and contain whole grains can help introduce healthy eating habits and can help mitigate chronic health conditions.<br/><br/>Added Sugars: School breakfasts are far too sugary, and I applaud the USDA’s proposed cap of no more than 10 percent of calories from added sugars, which mirrors the Dietary Guidelines recommendation. I also support USDA’s product-specific added sugars limits.  <br/><br/>Sodium: While these sodium reduction goals represent progress, the final limits do not go far enough and are out of alignment with the Dietary Guidelines’ quantitative recommendations. For instance, children up to age 8 will get 83 percent of their daily recommended sodium limit from breakfast and lunch combined, leaving just 17 percent leftover for snacks and dinner. A 13-year-old will get 77 percent of their daily limit from school breakfast and lunch, and high school students will get 63 percent.<br/><br/>Whole Grains: The two options proposed by the USDA require less than half of grains offered be whole, which is not aligned with the Dietary Guidelines’ recommendations. I encourage the USDA to strengthen the whole grain-rich requirement.<br/><br/>Healthy, wholesome meals provide children the nutrients they need to grow, develop and learn in and out of the classroom, and the 30 million kids who rely on school meals every day deserve better.

Indeed, based on your agency’s own findings, these birds would suffer major cumulative impacts from a land exchange and road. The supplemental draft EIS acknowledges greater impacts to these species under the agency’s preferred alternative compared to other alternatives, along with an increased risk of population level impacts. If these birds suffer population level declines, the harm to the Native Village of Hooper Bay and other tribes is likely to be severe and irreparable.  <br/><br/>Before making this decision, Secretary Haaland noted that respecting tribal sovereignty required listening to tribal communities. In making this decision, however, Sec. Haaland met only with the people of King Cove.  The Secretary has turned a deaf ear to dozens of Alaska tribes, including the Native Village of Hooper Bay, who repeatedly voiced opposition to the road and asked for the environmental study to be halted, and who seeks a reasonable compromise that would meet the stated need of the project and the people of King Cove, while avoiding irreparable harm to Western Alaska tribes..  <br/><br/>Please withdraw this project all together or, if you must move forward, choose the no action alternative because there are other viable options that will not result in irreparable harm to tribal communities in Western Alaska.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ruth Tretbar<br/>Oakland, CA",,

His name is Daniel Velez<br/><br/>I have been in long term care industry since 2001. The United States of America changed my life and my family for the better after given the opportunity to work as a Registered Nurse from the Philippines with a HIB Visa.<br/><br/>I legally followed the  process- became a Green Card Holder in 2005 and naturalized in 2010. Being a US citizen I am able to practice my rights to vote and voice my concerns are such a great privilege.<br/><br/>I moved up in the organization from a Registered Nurse working directly at the bedside with our most vulnerable  to the leadership role as a Nursing Director, Nurse Consultant, and currently, Vice President of Operations.<br/><br/>I have been awarded Nurse Administrator of the Year in 2012 through NADONA ( National Association of Directors of Nurses) and lead my teams to receive 3 AHCA Silver and 3 Bronze Awards for Quality Care. <br/><br/>I strongly believe that I have the duty to advocate for our residents, my team members ( Nurses, CNAs, and ancillary staff) but most importantly to honestly tell you our struggles day in and day out.<br/><br/>The unfunded staffing mandate in beyond my comprehension. Don’t get me wrong. I want the best quality of care for our residents. We have open positions for Nurses and CNAs daily even with incentives like attendance bonus, tuition loan forgiveness, pick up shift bonus, scholarships, amongst others.<br/><br/>It is not the question of we are not trying but the question of where can we get the staff requirements to meet the mandate?<br/><br/>For 2 consecutive years ( 2022 and 2023) through the the passion and dedication to excellence of Nexcare Wellbridge Senior Living and the support of the AHCA and HCAM , I have the opportunity to meet with our senators and House of Representatives from Michigan or their staff to echo these concerns particularly on the staffing crisis.<br/><br/>Personally here’s my solution with other myriad solutions . I will focus on ONE and only ONE- increase the visa capacity, don’t have a cap and process speedily the Working Visa for RNs.  You know why? It worked. I am a living example of a productive citizen of the country because I was granted an H1B Visa in 2001. <br/><br/>I urge you to stop the unfunded staffing mandate. There’s no staff to meet the demands. At the end of the day, our most vulnerable residents will suffer and operators will close some nursing homes  for not meeting the requirements of this mandate. Let’s work collaboratively to find solutions. Hence, I am passionate to write you my thoughts on the issue but offer solutions as well.<br/><br/>I am confident that you will do the best for our country . I am contemplating of leaving long term care but my drive and passion otherwise is stronger - I will serve our most vulnerable and lead my organization for Quality Care because this is what I called to do for a much better and stronger Michigan and United States.<br/><br/>God Bless You!<br/><br/>Alma Olivares",,
USBC-2018-0005-45322,Comment from Kirstie Johnson,Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM),"Dear Departmental Paperwork Clearance Officer Jennifer Jessup,<br/><br/>I write as part of the Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM), a network of organizations committed to immigrant justice and a fair and accurate population count. The goal of the Census is to count ALL individuals living in the United States, regardless of immigration status. The census is a tool for the U.S. government to obtain a snap shot of our nations demographics and one that is critical to the apportionment of seats in Congress. The addition of a citizenship question is harmful to the overall accuracy and integrity of the Census and I object to its inclusion in the 2020 Census. <br/><br/>Nationally, 16.7 million people live in mixed immigration status households. The members of these families are very much a part of our country and communities and adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census threatens to erase their presence in our country. In the early years of the Census, questions about whether to include representation of African Americans and American Indians surfaced.  While eventually both populations were fully included in the count, these are reminders of the fight for representation of communities of color in the United States and a history we cannot repeat. The inclusion of the citizenship question would do exactly that. <br/> <br/>Additionally, including a question that would make it more difficult to capture our communities accurately will lead to an increase in the cost in the Census. This would mean more taxpayer money to complete a Census count that will likely not be the most accurate. An inaccurate count could mean the loss of local funding that supports important programs and infrastructure projects in our communities.  <br/><br/>The Census should stay committed to the goal of counting every person who resides in the United States, regardless of status.

VA-2019-VHA-0008-10684,Comment on AQ46-Proposed Rule-Comment Submission,None,"I wholeheartedly endorse the proposed rule, 'Veterans Community Care Program,'' and urge its earliest adoption.  For too long Veterans have been forced to endure substandard care at VA facilities.  While much of the care provided is first rate, those times when the VA fails the veteran, it fails spectacularly, and currently, veterans have no alternative but to endure those failures.  This proposed rule will require the VA to meet basic access and quality standards for treating veterans, and where the VA fails to meet those standards, gives veterans the right to go outside the VA for their health care, with the VA still paying for that care.  Specifically, I think the access standards proposed are both reasonable and timely.  If anything, they require the veteran to wait too long for access to VA care. In fact, I encourage the VA to adopt the 14 days standard for access to primary care and behavioral health care immediately, and not step that down from 20 days in 2019 to 14 days in 2020.  Further, I think the 28-day standard for access to specialist care is also too long for a veteran to wait.  However, I believe the 'best medical interest' standard proposed is crucial to the proper operation of this program, and provides a 'safety valve' for the inadequate access standards.  Specifically, while the proposed rule says the health care provider and the veteran will determine if non-VA care is in the best interest of the veteran, other parts of the proposed rule would seem to argue that non-health care provider medical administrators in the VA would also review that 'best medical interest' decision.  I absolutely reject that idea.  The 'best medical interest' decision to access non-VA care MUST be left to the clinician and veteran alone, and not subject to further VA medical administrator review.  Too often under the current system, VA doctors and clinicians prescribe non-VA care, only to be overruled by VA medical administrators who have no contact with the patient.  This must stop.  Thank for the opportunity to comment on this regulation.  Overall, I find this a great proposed rule, and urge it be adopted as soon as possible.",,

CEQ-2019-0003-548971,MM49 Comment Submitted by Gage Combs,None,"Attn: Docket No. CEQ-2019-0003<br/><br/>I am writing in support of the Administration's efforts to reform the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). For nearly four decades, NEPA's burdensome and overbearing regulations have held back American infrastructure, hurt our workers, and crippled small businesses across the country.<br/><br/>It's time for that to change. We must take advantage of the opportunity we have to modernize NEPA. Reforming NEPA would unleash American investment, create jobs across the country, and give a boost to our economy. <br/><br/>Right now, the United States ranks near the bottom in permitting among industrialized countries - 26 out of 33 - according to the World Bank's most recent 'Doing Business' study.<br/><br/>The Council on Environmental Quality's proposed reform would be a huge win for American workers and businesses across the country. It will reduce delays and uncertainties and lower the overall risk for companies - resulting in greater transparency and predictability for local governments and small businesses.<br/><br/>The list of stakeholders who would benefit is long. They include but are not limited to: state and local governments, infrastructure workers and the building trades, agriculture, clean energy, forestry, manufacturing, transportation, and small businesses.<br/><br/>The benefits of reforming NEPA are incalculable and we must act now. I strongly support the Council on Environmental Quality's proposed reforms.<br/><br/>Regards, <br/>Gage Combs<br/>184 oak ridge place<br/>Mount Airy, NC, 27030<br/>",,

They are wrong.<br/>Doing this  is  hurting  the person mentally physically. It also hurts   their family  who accept them as humans, as  a person, as a family member, a son a friend  and person like millions   and billions  who had  prepared  their education to serve  the community in different carriers.<br/>Today  those persons who do not know  who the person  who saved  their lives   it is a person with a different  gender.<br/><br/>I believe dearly, That  what should matter  about  any person ;No matter their gender it is what they had prepared  to  be someone responsible useful for the community. Weather they get low pay  their service  to the community  to this world of people should be respected.<br/>Gender should never become between what  a person can work , teach, serve as a nurse, doctor, psychologist or  other carrier ,to gain their daily bread  for their family, their children,  college, training carrier.Doing it for the sake  of  their family , paying  for their own apartment,home,medical bills or and for  themselves.<br/><br/>My father  and my mother always told me and  reminded me  that nothing changes  a person genders only  they can change  what they prepare themselves  to serve  the needs   of  the community.<br/>Thank you for your attention and consideration.

BOEM-2022-0031-134992,"Comment from Freeman, Trudy",None,"To Whom It May Concern: <br/><br/>I am disappointed to learn the Department of the Interior is proposing major restrictions on future natural gas and oil lease sales, and even considering ending future sales entirely. At a time when prices for everything are rising and there isn’t enough energy to meet demand, we should be opening our federal waters for responsible development - not closing them for extended periods.   <br/><br/>No new lease sales over the next 5 years, as considered in the latest DOI 5-year proposal, could be a disaster for our economy as we are trying to recover from a global energy crisis, fix our supply chains, and avoid a recession. How are families supposed to keep up if the cost of just getting to work or school keeps rising? How are small businesses or large employers alike going to hire or retain workers if it’s more expensive to keep the lights on? The government needs to take serious action to increase our energy supply - and do it quickly!  <br/><br/>We have some of the largest natural gas and oil reserves in the world right off our shores, on government-owned land, so why aren’t we using them? We know how to develop this energy responsibly. So, let’s make sure that America has a secure energy supply, so we can keep our economy going without relying on imports from overseas.  <br/><br/>For all these reasons, I ask you to support American energy by rejecting a continued pause on lease sales and committing to a reliable offshore leasing schedule that includes all of the 11 proposed sales. Offshore oil and gas leasing is crucial for our economy and national security, and we can’t afford to delay any longer.  ",,

ATF-2021-0001-21495,Comment on FR Doc # 2021-10058,None,"Your own agency testified against this just 4 months ago! What changed? Politics, or the Constitution which you are sworn to uphold?<br/><br/>RE: ATF 2021R-05<br/><br/>The ATF must immediately withdraw their proposed rules to criminalize so-called ""ghost guns."" <br/> <br/>To start, the very phrase ""ghost guns"" is a politically charged pejorative used to scare Americans and justify the infringement on our right to craft a homemade firearm  -  a right ancillary to the Second Amendment. <br/> <br/>In fact, some of the items being classified as ""ghost guns"" are best described as non-firearms because they do not meet any federal definition and are not functioning weapons. <br/> <br/>Other items referred to as ""ghost guns"" are completed ""80% receiver"" kits which can be described as ""fully functioning homemade firearms"" rather than the manipulative phrase ""ghost guns."" <br/> <br/>When the State of California and Giffords Law Center sued to force the ATF to enact gun control by ""alleg[ing] threats posed by 'ghost guns,'"" it was the ATF that filed a motion to DISMISS the case. <br/> <br/>Here's what the ATF said in January 2021: ""While any specific crime is a tragedy, eight such crimes out of the 1.1 million violent crimes committed in the relevant six-year-period is a far cry from an overwhelming wave that would cause a State injury sufficient to confer standing. [...] Nor can California plausibly plead that those crimes would not have occurred with traditional, serialized firearms."" <br/> <br/>The ATF must live by its own words and recognize the constitutional right of United States citizens to craft their own firearms to keep themselves safe. <br/> <br/>No proposed gun control law-including the proposed regulation of so-called ""ghost guns""-will stop criminals from being able to obtain and use firearms in the commission of crimes.",,

ED-2021-OCR-0166-113008,Comment on FR Doc # 2022-13734,None,"I strongly oppose the Department's proposed rule to include ""termination of pregnancy"" as a form of ""discrimination based on sex"" in Title IX. <br/><br/>This proposed rule forces colleges to make abortion accessible to students or lose their federal funding, even in states that protect preborn life. This places the Administration's abortion agenda as more important than higher education for America's young people. <br/><br/>This proposed rule will also force healthcare practitioners to violate their consciences and sincerely held religious beliefs.<br/><br/>Finally, this rule seems to force religious K-12 schools and universities who receive any kind of federal funding to violate their convictions and provide abortion access to their students.<br/><br/>America's girls deserve better. Fifty years of Title IX should be celebrated for opening the door to the many amazing accomplishments women have achieved-not hijacked as a means through which this Administration seeks to advance its extreme abortion agenda. I urge you to rescind this rule.",,
