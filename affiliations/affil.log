INFO - Comment: As a Staff / Board member  of the AZA accredited Louisville Zoo in Kentucky, I would like to express my strong support for the conservation effort by the Dallas Zoo, Sedgwick County Zoo and Omaha Henry Doorly Zoo to help balance the environment in Swaziland by importing and providing new homes for 18 Swaziland elephants at these US Zoos.  This partnership with the Kingdom of Swaziland Wildlife Management Authority will support the welfare of the  elephants and critically endangered rhinos in Africa as well.  These elephants would become part of the North American population managed by zoos which are accredited by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums (AZA) and will help to reduce the number of elephants in Swazilands parks to sustainable levels while lessening competition for the limited resources available to African elephants and rhinos in the area.  Relocation within the region is not favorable due to excessive poaching, loss of habitat, and significant drought conditions.  If not relocated, these magnificent creatures will be culled. Each partner zoo has the resources to provide the elephants with wonderful new homes, proper nutrition and excellent veterinary care.  In addition, the ongoing support for Swazilands in-situ rhino conservation program by the partner zoos will contribute to the survival of the rhinos.  AZA zoos support research and maintain partnerships that educate the public. This public awareness is key to the conservation of many endangered species including African elephants and rhinos. <br/>

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Azar,<br/><br/>I write to comment on the proposed rule on Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  The previous administrations expansion of the definition of sex in this section to include gender identity could have tragic repercussions if it were ever implemented.  I am glad to see you clarifying that sex should be defined by its ordinary meaning.<br/><br/>Though it supports the ideology of gender identity, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) understands the binary nature of sex and the need for the distinction. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) the APA defines sex as the Biological indication of male and female (understood in the context of reproductive capacity), such as sex chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, and nonambiguous internal and external genitalia.<br/><br/>If doctors and scientists treated patients without considering their biological makeup patient outcomes would suffer. Just recently, a woman lost her baby because she presented to the hospital as male and her symptoms werent properly diagnosed.<br/><br/>Additionally, this change is consistent with the rest of the Trump Administration and Congressional interpretation.  In October of 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a memo to all United States Attorneys and heads of department components regarding employment sex discrimination cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  This memo states that "Sex is ordinarily defined to mean biologically male or female. . . . . Congress has confirmed this ordinary meaning [] in several other statutes[.] Congress has repeatedly declined to enact legislation to include gender identity in the definition of sex in various areas of nondiscrimination law and any such change should be the prerogative of Congress, not the agencies.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Belinda Kangombe

INFO - Comment: As an individual concerned about ensuring that patients have access to accurate and reliable laboratory test results, I am writing in response to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Jan. 9, 2018 Request for Information pertaining to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) regulations. I am opposed to the Agency's flawed policy that a bachelor's degree in nursing is equivalent to a bachelor's degree in the biological sciences, as well as its proposal to list nursing "as a separate qualifying degree...for purposes of meeting the educational requirements for moderate and high complexity testing personnel and technical consultants."<br/><br/>A bachelor's degree in nursing is NOT equivalent to a biological sciences degree, and it does not provide academic instruction sufficient to perform or supervise non-waived laboratory testing. A biological sciences degree may require 60 semester hours or more of biological and chemical sciences-much of it upper level-whereas a nursing degree typically requires fewer than 15 semester hours of biological and or chemical science-most of which tends to be introductory/survey level. As a degree, it is insufficient to provide the necessary scientific knowledge and training in non-waived laboratory procedures. <br/><br/>Unless a bachelor's degree is substantially equivalent in terms of its course load and level and related laboratory training/experience, it should not allow its holder to perform high complexity testing or supervise non-waived laboratory testing. While I am aware of workforce shortages in the laboratory, these should not be solved by employing individuals from another health care discipline that has its own shortage situation. Patient safety demands quality laboratory testing performed by qualified individuals.<br/><br/>I urge you to "Put Patients First" by not allowing the nursing degree to satisfy CLIA's high complexity educational requirements.<br/><br/>Sincerely,

INFO - Comment: National Marine Fisheries Service    Dear National Marine Fisheries Service,  I'm deeply concerned about the impact of your agency's fishery management decisions on ocean ecosystems. I believe that strong environmental review is critical to the health of our oceans. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has made it possible to protect thousands of square miles of deep sea coral formations, save the lives of endangered sea turtles and begin rebuilding of depleted fish populations.   Unfortunately your agency's proposed NEPA rule hands over too much authority to fishery management councils that have a long history of poor management, significantly limits the public's ability to participate in fishery management decisions, and allows fishery managers to make decisions about fishing without fully considering the impacts on marine ecosystems including sea turtles, seals, corals and other precious ocean life.  Please withdraw this flawed NEPA proposal and craft a new one that will ensure protection of our ocean ecosystems. Our oceans are in trouble. I've seen in my own life how decades of mismanagement have degraded the oceans. It's time for our nation's fisheries managers to make better decisions by fully understanding the consequences of fishing on marine ecosystems.   Thank you for your time and consideration.

INFO - Comment: Dr. James Kendall,<br/> <br/>I urge the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to stop preparing for a lease sale in the Beaufort Sea in 2019. The current five-year offshore leasing program does not allow for new lease sales in the Beaufort Sea. Preparing for a new lease sale at this point is premature and indicates that BOEM has pre-determined the outcome of planning process it is currently undertaking for 2019?2024?even though a new program is still in its initial stages.<br/> <br/>There is no compelling reason to rush to sell leases in the Beaufort Sea. In recent years, oil companies have walked away from investments there. Moreover, drilling in these waters could cause enormous damage. A major oil spill could have severe consequences and would be all but impossible to clean up. Even routine oil and gas operations create noise, air and water pollution, and they generate air and vessel traffic that can have serious consequences.<br/> <br/>If BOEM continues to consider a 2019 Beaufort Sea lease sale, it should exclude offshore areas with particularly important biological or cultural importance. These areas include the Barrow Canyon area, the region between Oliktok Point and Demarcation Bay, Smith Bay, the Harrison Bay?Colville Delta region, and the Beaufort shelf break. In addition, BOEM should heed requests to exclude areas that are important for subsistence hunting.<br/> <br/>Sincerely,

INFO - Comment: <br/>As a physician anesthesiologist, I believe all patients, especially Medicare patients, deserve high-quality care. This is why I strongly urge the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure that the requirement of physician involvement in the anesthesia care of Medicare patients is reinstated.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE), CMS issued a temporary waiver of the Medicare requirement of physician anesthesiologists in anesthesia care to prepare for potential shortages of physician providers.  Unfortunately, this was done without substantial justification; the pandemic does not necessitate this policy change because the existing supervision rule already provides for flexibility, deferring to state Governors to opt-out of the requirement if necessary. There have been no demonstrated shortages of anesthesia providers, and states have rescinded early waivers noting that the elimination of physician involvement related to anesthesia care serves no purpose. Further, replacing physician anesthesiologist-led care does not create any cost savings nurse anesthetists and physician anesthesiologists bill Medicare the same amount.<br/><br/>As the public health emergency continues, physicians and all providers on the front lines know that the Medicare waiver is unnecessary.  We have seen that COVID-19 has reinforced the need for team-based anesthesia and critical care services as their expertise and training is critical to the care of COVID-positive patients.  Covid-19 can cause serious lung and breathing problems in patients of all ages; one of the key roles of an anesthesiologist during surgery is to maintain a patient's breathing.  Older patients infected with COVID-19 are some of the most complex and challenging cases a physician will see in their career.  Now is not the time to take the physician away from patients.<br/><br/>Any attempt to permanently remove physician involvement in anesthesia care is dangerous and lowers the standard of care. Many Medicare patients have conditions that put them at higher risk during surgery. While the nurse-only model of care may be appropriate for other health care settings such as primary care, it is not a safe approach for Medicare beneficiaries in the acute, critical, and perioperative care settings, where life-threatening situations occur unpredictably. It is these instances where a physician's significant training and education is required for accurate diagnosis and successful intervention. When seconds count, you want a medical doctor leading a patient's care, not a nurse.<br/><br/>Medicare patients deserve to have access to the highest quality, team-based model of anesthesia care to ensure their safety. I urge you preserve the current Medicare anesthesia safety standard.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>Dr. Venkat R. Mangunta Missouri

INFO - Comment: I am writing as a responsible tobacco retailer in Texas to oppose the proposed ban on licensed retailers selling menthol cigarettes to adults 21 and older.  I am proud of the work we do every day to make sure menthol cigarettes and other tobacco products are sold only to adults 21 and older.  Please do not move forward with this unfair proposal that could harm tobacco retailers across the United States by shifting many of these products to illegal sellers that don't care who they sell to or how they do it.<br/><br/>If implemented, this proposal could hurt retailers and wholesalers in the U.S. and directly impact my bottom line.  This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue; menthol cigarettes alone make up 36% of all cigarette sales in the United States.   Additionally, adult customers who purchase menthol cigarettes also purchase gas, food, and other items that my store depends on.<br/><br/>It makes no sense to end the sale of these products through licensed retail stores like mine.  Bans could shift sales to illegal markets where many consumers can still get them, but without any regulatory protection or underage prevention. Flavor bans create illegal markets that could endanger the public with bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access, crime, arrests, and community conflict.<br/><br/>Underage use of menthol cigarettes is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21 -- not with bans that create illegal markets.  Responsible, licensed retailers like me have worked hard to comply with age-verification requirements, and these efforts are a big reason why underage rates have fallen so low.<br/><br/>I respectfully urge you to reconsider a ban on menthol cigarettes, and instead focus on more positive solutions that respect the role of responsible, legal businesses like mine.  Instead of banning products for adults, the government should be giving adult smokers more information and choices for lower risk tobacco products -- as well as continuing to focus on underage prevention and education.<br/>

This change has serious implications for acupuncturists and my ability to prescribe medications my patients need for their health care. Homeopathy is in the scope of practice of all licensed physicians in the U.S., while three states specifically license homeopathic physicians, and 24 states explicitly include it in the scope of practice of licensed naturopaths and/or acupuncturists. The Draft Guidance is affecting my ability to access homeopathic medicines and conflicts with states' authority over the practice of medicine.<br/><br/>Therefore, I urge you to adopt a policy that adheres to the law either by A) implementing the regulatory framework offered in a currently pending Citizen Petition submitted in June 2020 by Americans for Homeopathy Choice, a consumer organization whose goals I support, or by B) rescinding the Draft Guidance and working with stakeholders on a policy that does not subvert the regulatory process, which is intended to allow the affected public to have a role in shaping new regulations and have access to the courts to challenge them once adopted.

Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning flavored cigars could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since flavored cigars alone generate $4 to $5 billion in annual retail sales and make up 37% to 47% of popular price large cigars sold in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of flavored cigars could undermine my ability to operate by impacting my revenue. <br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, sales of flavored cigars could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime in many states.    Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of flavored cigars is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.  <br/>

Larger, older trees are also far more fire resistant, and a well-constructed rule would not preclude necessary, science-based efforts to address the risk of fire.   <br/><br/>Unfortunately, vital mature forests and trees on federal lands are currently threatened by numerous proposed and ongoing logging projects, in spite of President Biden’s executive order to conserve them. We need to ensure America's mature and old-growth trees and forests remain in place to mitigate climate change, and to maintain their natural benefits for future generations. Thank you for your leadership on these important issues.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Sara Brydges<br/>Concord, MA 01742<br/>sbrydges@comcast.net

INFO - Comment: I am writing to oppose your proposal to rescind the regulatory definition of “harm” under the Endangered Species Act. <br/><br/>Habitat destruction is the main driver of species decline. When Congress passed the Endangered Species Act, it explicitly recognized the importance of habitat in protecting and restoring endangered species. And the definition of harm you seek to delete was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court 30 years ago. If anything, the case for habitat protection under the ESA has grown even stronger since then, with mountains of scientific evidence linking habitat and species’ survival.   <br/><br/>There is no rational reason to rescind this definition; rescission only serves as an invitation to timber, oil, mining and other extractive industries, as well as the government and individuals, to try to destroy habitat that endangered species need to live, eat, and raise their young. Common sense, science, and the ESA itself tells us that habitat destruction harms species.  <br/><br/>Just one company or project can destroy habitat, but when a species disappears, we all suffer the consequences, which can include impacts to our food and water supply, to industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to tourism, and to our cultural and spiritual values.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>John Ouellette<br/>Manchester, NH

The 2017 rule included provisions that would disallow the industry to continue to self-police with the use of DQPs, and ban the use of chains and other action devices used to sore horses. <br/> <br/>Over 100,000 public comments were submitted on the proposed rule, while hundreds of members of Congress also wrote in support.<br/> <br/>The USDA must act expediently to end this cruelty, which continues to plague the Tennessee walking horse industry and affect other gaited breeds. <br/><br/>I do not support withdrawing this rule without the introduction of new regulations to ban soring and hope a rule will be quickly introduced that incorporates new information, including recommendations found in the 2021 National Academies of Science report, “Review of Methods for Detecting Soreness in Horses.”<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Miss Darelyn Haynes

INFO - Title: Comment from Litman, Laurie
INFO - Comment: I urge the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries to rescind in full the 2019 Trump-era regulations that severely weakened protections for our nation’s most imperiled animals and plants. These changes represented the most significant rollbacks to the Endangered Species Act in the law’s 50-year history and pushed hundreds of species closer to the brink of extinction.  <br/> <br/>It is extremely disappointing that this proposed rule retains a number of harmful provisions governing the responsibility of federal agencies to avoid jeopardizing protected species or adversely modifying their critical habitat. In particular, it retains a definition of “adverse modification” that requires federal actions to affect species’ critical habitat “as a whole” before real habitat protections are put in place. This is especially harmful for species like the northern spotted owl, polar bear or gulf sturgeon that have large critical habitat designations but are still at risk of extinction. The provision ignores the basic fact that the single largest driver of extinction here and around the world is habitat loss and allows the Services to turn a blind eye to the vast majority of actions that harm critical habitat.  <br/> <br/>The proposed rule also retains the Trump-era definition of “environmental baseline,” which lets federal agencies off the hook for past harms to endangered species from things like dam or highway construction by deeming these projects part of the baseline. It absolves the agencies of much responsibility for the damage caused by interrelated actions they facilitate, such as urban growth from highway expansion or increased global warming from emissions related to federal oil and gas leasing.  <br/> <br/>The remaining Trump-era regulations that the agencies are proposing to retain — including the criteria for not prudent determinations for critical habitat — are equally problematic and will continue to put endangered species at greater risk of extinction. Thus, I urge the Services to rescind them in their entirety without exception. <br/> <br/>There are some aspects of the proposed rule that I support. I am grateful that the Biden administration plans to restore the “blanket 4(d) rule,” which will restore protections for threatened species. I also support reinserting the provision that prohibits consideration of economic impacts when deciding to protect species, as well as the provision that removes barriers to designate critical habitat for climate-impacted species.  <br/><br/>However, while the proposed rule restores some pieces of the Endangered Species Act regulations, it is wholly inadequate and represents a huge missed opportunity to make meaningful progress to recover our most vulnerable animals and plants on the 50th anniversary of the Act’s passage.  <br/> <br/>With time running out, we can’t afford more of the status quo. Combating the global wildlife extinction crisis will require the Services to be bolder and more visionary than any other administration in history. For these reasons, I urge the Services to not only rescind the Trump-era rollbacks in their entirety, but to also strengthen the implementation of the Endangered Species Act to avert the extinction crisis and curtail the ongoing loss of biodiversity in the United States and around the world.

Please do not move forward with this proposal that will repeat the same mistakes of prohibition of alcohol and cannabis. <br/><br/>Banning menthol cigarettes unfairly limits adult choices for tobacco products that are already highly regulated and age-restricted. Youth usage rates of cigarettes are the lowest in a generation.  Adult tobacco consumers 21+ should be allowed to buy menthol cigarettes if they want to.<br/><br/>This proposed ban could create an illegal market outside of all regulatory controls, including effective measures to keep tobacco products away from kids. If this ban takes effect, selling once legal products will suddenly become criminal activity.   History tells us that bans don't work.  Effective regulation and education are better solutions than creating illegal markets and increasing crime.<br/><br/>Please do not ban the sale of menthol cigarettes in the United States.

INFO - Comment: Please accept my comments on BLM’s proposed Public Lands Rule.<br/><br/>• The rule encourages designating additional Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) on public lands, which I support.<br/><br/>• The rule would set up a “conservation leasing” system that allows private parties to lease public lands for conservation and restoration purposes. In reality, it doesn’t appear the rule will achieve any such benefit. Since the rule requires that conservation leases must allow all ongoing activities to continue—even if they are destructive uses like livestock grazing—any benefit from restoration that might accrue from the lease would be seriously diminished.<br/><br/>• Wilderness areas should be exempt from the conservation leasing program. Leasing public lands for any purpose commodifies those lands—since commercial enterprise is generally banned in Wilderness, leasing Wilderness for any purpose would likely violate the Wilderness Act.<br/><br/>• The conservation leases put a heavy emphasis on active intervention, manipulation, and restoration. Such heavy-handed management runs counter to the fundamental tenet of the Wilderness Act to let nature be, so the intended management of the leased lands poses a risk to Wilderness. This is yet another reason Wilderness areas should be off-limits for conservation leases.<br/><br/>• BLM should unequivocally state in the new rule that the overarching mandate for wilderness stewardship is to preserve each area’s "untrammeled" or "wild" character.<br/><br/>• In lieu of conservation leases in Wilderness, there should be a mechanism for permanent retirement of grazing permits in Wilderness and other sensitive areas. At a minimum, there should also be a non-use status for 10 years of grazing allotments in Wilderness that do not meet land health standards. It would be preferable for the permits to be revoked until recovery occurs.

Also referred to as the Public Lands Rule, the Bureau of Land Management's interest in establishing parity for conservation with various other uses of our public lands is a critical move for achieving real balance in management.<br/><br/>Given that the BLM is the steward of our largest public lands estate, managing more than 245 million acres, the result of this rulemaking process would greatly benefit hunters and anglers who rely on healthy, intact landscapes to pursue fish and game. Valuing conservation of intact habitat - including migration corridors - on par with other uses provides an unparalleled opportunity for the BLM at a time when intense drought, severe wildfires and encroaching invasive species threaten our public lands.<br/><br/>As proposed, this rule would promote critical restoration work by utilizing conservation leasing, a new tool for BLM to manage healthy public lands and accommodate more novel mitigation approaches. Targeted conservation leasing could help restore degraded and fragmented landscapes, increasing their resilience and improving the connectivity of migratory corridors.<br/><br/>I want to thank the BLM for its commitment to improving the management of our public lands and waters through this proposed rule, which will improve the conservation of fish and wildlife habitat for the benefit of hunters and anglers.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Acosta,<br/><br/>I write to comment and commend the Department of Labor (DOL) on the proposed rule by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCCP) Implementing Legal Requirements Regarding the Equal Opportunity Clauses Religious Exemption. As noted in the proposed rule, steps like these to protect churches and other faith-based employers, ensuring they have a level playing field with others, are nothing new. The Civil Rights Act was signed into law by President Johnson in 1964 and, in Title VII, regarding employment, Congress provided important protections for religious employers. Congress even broadened these protections about a decade later.<br/><br/>President Johnson understood the need to ensure that faith-based employers had a level playing field of access to and competition for grants and took this into account in Executive Order (EO) 11246 on federal contracting.<br/><br/>When the DOL was tasked with enforcing EO 11246 in 1978 it included Title VIIs exemption for religious educational institutions in its implementing regulations. In 2002 President Bush amended the EO by including Title VIIs exemption for religious organizations, which has since also been implemented by DOLs regulations.<br/><br/>It wasnt until the Obama administration that protections for faith-based employers were curtailed. The Trump administration DOL is reinvigorating these protections to their former status in line with, not only historical precedent, but recent decisions from the Supreme Court. For example, inTrinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, a church that ran a daycare center was denied access to a government grant program for nonprofit organizations to make their playgrounds safer for children, simply because they were a church. The Supreme Court made clear that Trinity Lutheran Church had just as much right to participate in the grant program as any other daycare center; their status as a church did not prevent them from playing an equal role in the public square. With this rule, the Trump administration DOL is simply affirming a principle the Supreme Court held to be squarely in line with the First Amendment by a 7-2 vote.<br/><br/>Religious liberty is a vital cornerstone of our nation. It is imperative that it is closely guarded and upheld. I commend the DOL for doing just that with this rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mrs. Sheilah Marshall

INFO - Comment: 2 comments:<br/>1) HH CAHPS: The accross the board requirement for 300 surveys per year is grossly disproportional for smaller agencies.  For example if you have 300 discharges per year you are reuiring that 100% of clients answer this survey whereas if you have 3000 clients it is only 10%.  Typically only 30% of people answer surveys.  This number needs to be a percentage of discharges not an across the board number.<br/>2) Face to Face encounters:  This is a huge burdeon for the sickest clients, those that are truely bedbound and the obese.  We have a clients who weigh over 700 pounds, they cannot get out, they do not fit on an ambulance stretcher, I do not know how we will meet this, the MD's do not do home visits either.  The other group are those that are elderly, cognitively disabled and bedridden that cannot get to the MD office any other way than by ambulance-this adds burdeon and expense for them and their caregivers.  many of these are on service for foley catheter changes and are seen 2 or 3 times a certification period only.

INFO - Comment: As a Catholic, I applaud efforts to ensure that pregnant women are supported throughout their pregnancy and have the resources necessary to raise healthy babies. We should all be working to build a society that stands with moms in need. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act was a major, bipartisan achievement toward that goal—an achievement made possible because Congress had the good sense to leave abortion out of it (as confirmed by senators who spoke on it at the time).<br/><br/>It is unconscionable that the EEOC is trying to corrupt this landmark law by interpreting it to require employers to grant accommodations for abortion, the complete opposite of supporting pregnancy, and not what Congress intended. I strongly urge the EEOC not to include abortion in its final regulations, and to enact a religious exemption that is more clear and robust than what is proposed and ensures that employers are not required to act contrary to their religious beliefs.<br/><br/>Democrats and Republicans were able to come together and do a good thing for pregnant women and their babies by passing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The EEOC should not sabotage their work by turning the law into an abortion-accommodating mandate.
