INFO - Comment: I am writing to respectfully encourage you not to move forward with this proposed rule (RIN 1024-AE38). <br/><br/>It would repeal a scientifically sound rule from 2015 prohibiting the use of some of the cruelest hunting tactics against predators on national preserves in Alaska. Such tactics include killing mother bears and cubs at den sites with the aid of artificial light, baiting brown and black bears, killing wolves and coyotes with pups during their denning season, killing swimming caribou or killing caribou from a motorboat, and using dogs to hunt black bears.<br/><br/>Allowing the use of brutal hunting tactics on highly vulnerable wildlife, such as denning mothers and cubs, is not only unconscionable, but also unlawful. Congress provided a clear directive to the National Park Service to "provide for the maintenance of sound populations of, and habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens of Alaska and the Nation" for the "benefit, use, education, and inspiration of present and future generations" (16 U.S.C. 3101(a)). These extreme hunting methods, which are neither used nor endorsed by the majority of sport hunters, violate this directive.<br/><br/>These barbaric, scientifically baseless, and unnecessary tactics decimate predators on public lands and undermine protection of natural diversity solely to boost numbers of prey species and cater to trophy hunters. Predators play a critically important role in an ecosystem, ensuring both diversity and proper ecosystem function. Brutal hunting methods such as baiting, hounding, killing young animals, and killing animals at their den sites should have no place on national preserve lands.<br/><br/>The 2015 NPS rule is consistent with federal law and the best available science, was subject to public review and comment, and outlaws only the most extreme hunting tactics in Alaska. I strongly encourage NPS to reject this deeply troubling proposal, and urge the agency to keep the 2015 prohibitions in place.

The variety of national and international events ranging from major sporting events to concerts to conventions are attracting a record number of visitors and diverse clientele to our community--all centered around the vibrant Las Vegas Strip. In 2023, 57.6 million people traveled to Las Vegas through Harry Reid International Airport breaking travel records. <br/><br/>Currently, there is only one roundtrip flight option between DCA and LAS daily. Adding a second DCA slot pair for DCA-LAS will augment travel options and open the Las Vegas market. By injecting Southwest competition into a market like DCA-LAS, it will produce lower airfares. With one additional roundtrip flight, the Department of Transportation (DOT) will enhance competition, expand access, and decrease ticket prices, offering travelers more convenient and affordable travel options to and from Las Vegas.<br/><br/>I strongly urge DOT to favorably consider Southwest's application under Docket DOT-OST-2024-0065 to provide daily and direct roundtrip service between DCA and Las Vegas.

DACA does not go far enough to protect young immigrants of this country because it leaves out an important group: children of parents on long term work visas. Children who also came to America at a very young age, who grew up here, and are facing self-deportation are not covered by DACA because they documented. This is an extreme injustice to a large group of children who also call America their home. To learn more, visit https://www.improvethedream.org/

INFO - Comment: President Joe Biden,<br/><br/>The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is broken. It was a simple but powerful idea:  borrowers working in public service would have their remaining student debt forgiven after 10 years. However, year after year, the Department of Education has rejected 98 out of every 100 public service workers who have applied to have their debts cancelled. I am just one of these student loan borrowers who teach in our schools, work in our hospitals, serve our country, and have shouldered the burden of keeping us safe on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. In exchange for our commitments to public service, we were promised that our student debt would be erased— a promise the Biden Administration should keep.<br/><br/>The student debt crisis also disproportionally hurts women and borrowers of color, magnifying inequality caused by a history of discrimination across the economy. The failure of PSLF isn’t just a broken promise, it is also a missed opportunity to address racial and gender inequity and deliver on President Biden’s promise to build back better. <br/><br/>President Biden and Education Secretary Cardona must immediately deliver student debt relief to public service workers.<br/><br/>For me and all borrowers who have worked for a decade in public service, President Biden and the Department of  Education should immediately discharge all of their federal student loans in full. Every borrower should immediately get credit for every month spent in public service, regardless of the type of federal student loan, payment plan, or other so-called requirements. Red tape and bureaucratic hurdles should not be a barrier to action—the Secretary should use all legal tools available to eliminate these unjust debts. <br/><br/>No more tricks or traps. It is time for the Biden Administration to keep the promise to public service workers and eliminate this debt.<br/><br/>perlao.san@gmail.com

INFO - Comment: Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>I appreciate the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) taking this common-sense step to implement increased bond amounts found in the Fluid Mineral Leases and Leasing Process. The new rules will likely alleviate the financial burden that has been placed on taxpayers for far too long. In the West we understand that fossil fuel development will continue for some time; we also understand that without proper oversight, we'll be left with the responsibility to clean up the mess. BLM's current rules fail to ensure that reclamation occurs in a complete way, and oil and gas companies have proven time and time again that without the proper incentive, they will abandon or sell their wells before cleaning them up.<br/><br/>For decades, the lack of sufficient reclamation bonds and oversight has left communities throughout the West to bear many impacts of oil and gas production, including many impacts that could have been avoided or mitigated. Many westerners live and often farm or ranch on land that overlies federal minerals. If they don't own the mineral rights, they often don't have any say in how oil companies use their property. When, as often happens, the companies orphan their wells or file for bankruptcy, the remaining infrastructure impedes ranching and other uses of the land. Unreclaimed wells can also leak toxic chemicals into groundwater, or damage the land. This often leads to a loss in livelihoods in the case of farmers and ranchers, or degraded health in the cases of rural communities.<br/><br/>I urge BLM to swiftly and effectively implement this common-sense rule to ensure communities like mine are protected from preventable harms from current and future oil and gas development.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms dorothy troup<br/>NM

INFO - Title: Comment on FR Doc # 2016-20989
INFO - Comment: I am an educator and a member of the National Education Association, and I urge the U.S. Department of Education to re-think its proposed regulations to implement the Every Student Succeeds Act's (ESSA) Title I supplement, not supplant fiscal requirement.  To support all students, implementation should be done in a way that preserves the law's longstanding commitment to equity while also ensuring that local efforts to better serve students most in need are not undermined.<br/><br/>Ensuring that every student has a meaningful opportunity to learn is a State's first responsibility.  For students to graduate college and career-ready requires the State to provide students with the resources necessary according to their needs, such as access to high-quality preschool, a well-rounded curriculum, participation in advanced coursework, and a safe and healthy learning environment with modern materials, technology, and facilities.<br/><br/>Through no fault of their own, and despite greater effort in many places, poorer communities are often unable to provide the same opportunity to students as those provided to students in wealthier communities.  <br/><br/>The defining purpose of Title I under ESSA is to layer federal funds on top of State and local funds to provide students from low-income families with the extra supports they need to thrive.  Although ESSA requires States to be compliant with the supplement, not supplant provision, only local educational agencies (LEAs) must meet a specific test. ESSA places the burden on LEA's, which have more limited means to correct for any deficiencies, rather than the State.<br/><br/>In addition, there is evidence that not all LEAs parcel out State and local funds to their schools equitably, leaving students without access to the extra supports they need.  This is a secondary concern compared to the disparity in funding between districts in a State, but a disparity nonetheless that could be fixed with a sensible federal regulation.<br/><br/>Some of the Department's proposed rules in how an LEA can demonstrate compliance with the supplement, not supplant provision promote or support local efforts to make funding more equitable.  Other rules, although well-intended, may lead to funding practices that run counter to the notion of fairness and could undercut what is in the best interests of students.<br/><br/>To support collaboratively designed efforts, the rules should be flexible enough to ensure that local efforts to promote diversity that have been shown to benefit all students, such as through magnet schools or community schools, should not be harmed unintentionally.<br/><br/>Educators are experts at working with students and helping them reach their potential and we are ready to lead implementation efforts in our communities so students have access to the public schools they deserve.  The State in particular and the LEA must do their parts also. We must also support efforts to show what that funding is spent on so we ensure students have access to the supports they need to succeed.<br/><br/>The Department's regulation as proposed demonstrates its willingness to listen to practitioners due to the additional flexibility and workforce protections included compared to the original proposal offered earlier this year.  I am asking the Department to reexamine for a second time its proposed regulation to ensure that a narrow emphasis on spending comparisons, which says little about actual needs, does not prompt the same straightjacket adherence to compliance that failed under the No Child Left Behind law and preempts local approaches that may better serve our most vulnerable students.

INFO - Comment: Dear David Bernhart,<br/><br/>I am writing to you today in support of the proposal to set a year-round 10-knot vessel speed restriction in parts of the Gulf of Mexico to protect the endangered Rice’s whale from collisions and noise pollution. <br/><br/>Fossil fuel exploration development and other human activities have made the Rice’s whale one of the most endangered large whale species in the world. Your own scientists have concluded that the death of even a single reproductive-age female would jeopardize the existence of this species.  <br/><br/>So, any way to mitigate risks to these whales’ survival should be implemented immediately.  This includes mandatory speed limits and other reasonable measures governing vessel traffic within the whales’ habitat:  <br/><br/>** a mandatory 10-knot speed limit; <br/>** no vessel transits at night; <br/>** utilize visual observers and maintain a separation distance of 500 m from Rice's whales; <br/>** use and operate an Automatic Identification System, or notify NMFS of transits through the habitat;  <br/>** and report deviations from these requirements to NMFS. <br/><br/>Based on the latest science showing that these whales are persistently found in waters 100-400 meters deep all the way to the U.S.-Mexico border, these measures are needed not only within the whales’ previously identified “core habitat,” but throughout the Gulf.  Slowing down for Gulf of Mexico whales is a key step and only one part of the protection that is needed. These whales can recover as long as conditions improve, but that all depends on our actions. Unless the Biden administration takes significant conservation actions, the U.S. is likely to cause the first extinction of a great whale species resulting from human activity. We cannot let that happen.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Carmen Pang<br/>Decatur, GA 30030

The variety of national and international events ranging from major sporting events to concerts to conventions are attracting a record number of visitors and diverse clientele to our community--all centered around the vibrant Las Vegas Strip. In 2023, 57.6 million people traveled to Las Vegas through Harry Reid International Airport breaking travel records. <br/><br/>Currently, there is only one roundtrip flight option between DCA and LAS daily. Adding a second DCA slot pair for DCA-LAS will augment travel options and open the Las Vegas market. By injecting Southwest competition into a market like DCA-LAS, it will produce lower airfares. With one additional roundtrip flight, the Department of Transportation (DOT) will enhance competition, expand access, and decrease ticket prices, offering travelers more convenient and affordable travel options to and from Las Vegas.<br/><br/>I strongly urge DOT to favorably consider Southwest's application under Docket DOT-OST-2024-0065 to provide daily and direct roundtrip service between DCA and Las Vegas. This will positively stimulate robust competition within the DCA-LAS market. Thank you for your consideration. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Pedro Palomino<br/>North Las Vegas,NV<br/>Pfpzepeda93@gmail.com

INFO - Comment: President Joe Biden,<br/><br/>The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is broken. It was a simple but powerful idea:  borrowers working in public service would have their remaining student debt forgiven after 10 years. However, year after year, the Department of Education has rejected 98 out of every 100 public service workers who have applied to have their debts cancelled. I am just one of these student loan borrowers who teach in our schools, work in our hospitals, serve our country, and have shouldered the burden of keeping us safe on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. In exchange for our commitments to public service, we were promised that our student debt would be erased— a promise the Biden Administration should keep.<br/><br/>The student debt crisis also disproportionally hurts women and borrowers of color, magnifying inequality caused by a history of discrimination across the economy. The failure of PSLF isn’t just a broken promise, it is also a missed opportunity to address racial and gender inequity and deliver on President Biden’s promise to build back better. <br/><br/>President Biden and Education Secretary Cardona must immediately deliver student debt relief to public service workers.<br/><br/>For me and all borrowers who have worked for a decade in public service, President Biden and the Department of  Education should immediately discharge all of their federal student loans in full. Every borrower should immediately get credit for every month spent in public service, regardless of the type of federal student loan, payment plan, or other so-called requirements. Red tape and bureaucratic hurdles should not be a barrier to action—the Secretary should use all legal tools available to eliminate these unjust debts. <br/><br/>No more tricks or traps. It is time for the Biden Administration to keep the promise to public service workers and eliminate this debt.<br/><br/>perlao.san@gmail.com

The new rules will likely alleviate the financial burden that has been placed on taxpayers for far too long. In the West we understand that fossil fuel development will continue for some time; we also understand that without proper oversight, we'll be left with the responsibility to clean up the mess. BLM's current rules fail to ensure that reclamation occurs in a complete way, and oil and gas companies have proven time and time again that without the proper incentive, they will abandon or sell their wells before cleaning them up.<br/><br/>For decades, the lack of sufficient reclamation bonds and oversight has left communities throughout the West to bear many impacts of oil and gas production, including many impacts that could have been avoided or mitigated. Many westerners live and often farm or ranch on land that overlies federal minerals. If they don't own the mineral rights, they often don't have any say in how oil companies use their property. When, as often happens, the companies orphan their wells or file for bankruptcy, the remaining infrastructure impedes ranching and other uses of the land. Unreclaimed wells can also leak toxic chemicals into groundwater, or damage the land. This often leads to a loss in livelihoods in the case of farmers and ranchers, or degraded health in the cases of rural communities.<br/><br/>I urge BLM to swiftly and effectively implement this common-sense rule to ensure communities like mine are protected from preventable harms from current and future oil and gas development.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms dorothy troup<br/>NM

INFO - Comment: I am an educator and a member of the National Education Association, and I urge the U.S. Department of Education to re-think its proposed regulations to implement the Every Student Succeeds Act's (ESSA) Title I supplement, not supplant fiscal requirement.  To support all students, implementation should be done in a way that preserves the law's longstanding commitment to equity while also ensuring that local efforts to better serve students most in need are not undermined.<br/><br/>Ensuring that every student has a meaningful opportunity to learn is a State's first responsibility.  For students to graduate college and career-ready requires the State to provide students with the resources necessary according to their needs, such as access to high-quality preschool, a well-rounded curriculum, participation in advanced coursework, and a safe and healthy learning environment with modern materials, technology, and facilities.<br/><br/>Through no fault of their own, and despite greater effort in many places, poorer communities are often unable to provide the same opportunity to students as those provided to students in wealthier communities.  <br/><br/>The defining purpose of Title I under ESSA is to layer federal funds on top of State and local funds to provide students from low-income families with the extra supports they need to thrive.  Although ESSA requires States to be compliant with the supplement, not supplant provision, only local educational agencies (LEAs) must meet a specific test. ESSA places the burden on LEA's, which have more limited means to correct for any deficiencies, rather than the State.<br/><br/>In addition, there is evidence that not all LEAs parcel out State and local funds to their schools equitably, leaving students without access to the extra supports they need.  This is a secondary concern compared to the disparity in funding between districts in a State, but a disparity nonetheless that could be fixed with a sensible federal regulation.<br/><br/>Some of the Department's proposed rules in how an LEA can demonstrate compliance with the supplement, not supplant provision promote or support local efforts to make funding more equitable.  Other rules, although well-intended, may lead to funding practices that run counter to the notion of fairness and could undercut what is in the best interests of students.<br/><br/>To support collaboratively designed efforts, the rules should be flexible enough to ensure that local efforts to promote diversity that have been shown to benefit all students, such as through magnet schools or community schools, should not be harmed unintentionally.<br/><br/>Educators are experts at working with students and helping them reach their potential and we are ready to lead implementation efforts in our communities so students have access to the public schools they deserve.  The State in particular and the LEA must do their parts also. We must also support efforts to show what that funding is spent on so we ensure students have access to the supports they need to succeed.<br/><br/>The Department's regulation as proposed demonstrates its willingness to listen to practitioners due to the additional flexibility and workforce protections included compared to the original proposal offered earlier this year.  I am asking the Department to reexamine for a second time its proposed regulation to ensure that a narrow emphasis on spending comparisons, which says little about actual needs, does not prompt the same straightjacket adherence to compliance that failed under the No Child Left Behind law and preempts local approaches that may better serve our most vulnerable students.

Slowing down for Gulf of Mexico whales is a key step and only one part of the protection that is needed. These whales can recover as long as conditions improve, but that all depends on our actions. Unless the Biden administration takes significant conservation actions, the U.S. is likely to cause the first extinction of a great whale species resulting from human activity. We cannot let that happen.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Carmen Pang<br/>Decatur, GA 30030

INFO - Comment: I am writing to respectfully encourage you not to move forward with this proposed rule (RIN 1024-AE38). It would repeal a scientifically sound rule from 2015 prohibiting the use of some of the cruelest hunting tactics against predators on national preserves in Alaska. Such tactics include killing mother bears and cubs at den sites with the aid of artificial light, baiting brown and black bears, killing wolves and coyotes with pups during their denning season, killing swimming caribou or killing caribou from a motorboat, and using dogs to hunt black bears.<p>Allowing the use of brutal hunting tactics on highly vulnerable wildlife, such as denning mothers and cubs, is not only unconscionable, but also unlawful. Congress provided a clear directive to the National Park Service to 'provide for the maintenance of sound populations of, and habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens of Alaska and the Nation' for the 'benefit, use, education, and inspiration of present and future generations' (16 U.S.C. 3101(a)). These extreme hunting methods, which are neither used nor endorsed by the majority of sport hunters, violate this directive.<p>These barbaric, scientifically baseless, and unnecessary tactics decimate predators on public lands and undermine protection of natural diversity solely to boost numbers of prey species and cater to trophy hunters. Predators play a critically important role in an ecosystem, ensuring both diversity and proper ecosystem function. Brutal hunting methods such as baiting, hounding, killing young animals, and killing animals at their den sites should have no place on national preserve lands.<p>The 2015 NPS rule is consistent with federal law and the best available science, was subject to public review and comment, and outlaws only the most extreme hunting tactics in Alaska. I strongly encourage NPS to reject this deeply troubling proposal, and urge the agency to keep the 2015 prohibitions in place.

INFO - Comment: Dear U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  <br/><br/>I strongly urge you to finalize Endangered Species Act protection for monarch butterflies without delay. <br/><br/>The science is clear: Migratory monarch populations are facing extinction. Safeguards are urgently needed to rebuild monarch numbers because these once-common butterflies have drastically declined and now need our help to survive. <br/><br/>Protection for these beloved butterflies is warranted because of growing threats from climate change, logging of their winter habitat in Mexico and California, pesticides, ongoing loss of milkweed and wildflowers to sprawl development, and disease.  <br/><br/>Monarch protections should include safeguards from pesticides, especially insecticides that are particularly harmful to pollinators. <br/><br/>The Endangered Species Act listing should protect monarchs from commercial sale because mass-reared monarchs threaten the health of wild populations. <br/><br/>The listing should identify measures to prevent the import of avocados grown on illegally deforested lands in monarchs’ winter habitat.  <br/><br/>Monarchs also need a comprehensive recovery plan, conservation funding, and critical habitat designation. <br/><br/>I strongly support the proposal to protect their overwintering habitat in California. But eastern monarchs also need critical habitat, especially along their migratory corridors. <br/><br/>The Service should include national wildlife refuges and other federal lands in critical habitat for eastern monarchs so that they have designated protected areas to complete their migratory journeys. <br/><br/>Monarchs are culturally significant across North America. <br/><br/>Generations of students have learned about metamorphosis by watching their amazing lifecycle. <br/><br/>Please make sure these orange-and-black beauties survive for future generations by finalizing their protection.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Peg Blechman<br/>DC 20008

INFO - Comment: Dear Director Jane Norton,<br/><br/>The mission of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to put the health and well-being of the public first. But instead of working to ensure everyone has equal access to comprehensive and nondiscriminatory services, HHS is asking for suggestions on how to expand the use of religious beliefs to discriminate and deny patients health care.<br/>It is not the case that faith-based entities are facing barriers to participating in HHS programs. What some faith-based entities have identified as barriers are simply non-discrimination requirements, as well as laws and programs conditions that require the delivery of essential and medically necessary health care services. The non-discrimination requirements, laws, and program conditions are not barriers, but rather fundamental legal requirements from which there can be no "accommodation." <br/><br/>A health care provider's religious beliefs should never determine the care a patient receives, and patients should not have to fear that a health care provider will turn them away due to religious or moral beliefs. Yet, hospitals use religious beliefs to refuse to treat a woman seeking abortion, even when it is the standard of care; pharmacies cite religion to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions, and providers refuse to treat LGBTQ individuals simply because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. When these refusals happen, patients suffer harmful health consequences. The harms caused by refusals to provide care have a disproportionate impact on those who already face multiple barriers to care, including communities of color, LGBTQ individuals, people facing language barriers, and those struggling to make ends meet.<br/>HHS should not be looking for ways to make it easier for entities to let religion dictate patient care. Instead, HHS should follow its mission and commit to protect individual health and well-being. It should ensure that all entities participating in HHS programs adhere to federal nondiscrimination requirements and requirements to provide patients with evidence-based essential care. And HHS should seek ways to address the real discrimination that women, LGBTQ people, and others face  every day.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Sharon Sickles<br/>  Des Moines, IA 50311

It is critical that we prioritize the protection of mature and old-growth forests and trees to meet these goals.<br/><br/>As your agencies have identified, older forests and trees are crucial for addressing the interlinked climate and biodiversity crises. These trees store the vast majority of the above-ground carbon in a forest. Older forests and trees are also far more adaptable to the impacts of climate change, especially compared to industrial tree plantations.<br/><br/>Furthermore, these ecosystems provide vital and unique habitats for wildlife, and intact forested watersheds produce high-quality water vital for aquatic life in the forest and those who depend on it downstream.<br/><br/>We urge you to include an end to ecologically harmful logging of mature and old-growth forests and trees on federal land in any future administrative rules. While there are certainly other threats to our older forests, like wildfire and drought, the threat of logging is fully under your control and can be addressed immediately.<br/><br/>We ask you to act quickly to protect mature forests and trees. Not only are they more valuable to us now standing up, with your protection they can grow to become old-growth and continue to help mitigate the climate crisis, contribute to healthy watersheds and foster resilient ecosystems.

INFO - Title: Comment from Taniguchi, Naomi
INFO - Comment: I urge the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries to rescind in full the 2019 Trump-era regulations that severely weakened protections for our nation_s most imperiled animals and plants. These changes represented the most significant rollbacks to the Endangered Species Act in the law_s 50-year history and pushed hundreds of species closer to the brink of extinction.  <br/> <br/>It is extremely disappointing that this proposed rule retains a number of harmful provisions governing the responsibility of federal agencies to avoid jeopardizing protected species or adversely modifying their critical habitat. In particular, it retains a definition of _adverse modification_ that requires federal actions to affect species_ critical habitat _as a whole_ before real habitat protections are put in place. This is especially harmful for species like the northern spotted owl, polar bear or gulf sturgeon that have large critical habitat designations but are still at risk of extinction. The provision ignores the basic fact that the single largest driver of extinction here and around the world is habitat loss and allows the Services to turn a blind eye to the vast majority of actions that harm critical habitat.  <br/> <br/>The proposed rule also retains the Trump-era definition of _environmental baseline,_ which lets federal agencies off the hook for past harms to endangered species from things like dam or highway construction by deeming these projects part of the baseline. It absolves the agencies of much responsibility for the damage caused by interrelated actions they facilitate, such as urban growth from highway expansion or increased global warming from emissions related to federal oil and gas leasing.  <br/> <br/>The remaining Trump-era regulations that the agencies are proposing to retain _ including the criteria for not prudent determinations for critical habitat _ are equally problematic and will continue to put endangered species at greater risk of extinction. Thus, I urge the Services to rescind them in their entirety without exception. <br/> <br/>There are some aspects of the proposed rule that I support. I am grateful that the Biden administration plans to restore the _blanket 4(d) rule,_ which will restore protections for threatened species. I also support again prohibiting consideration of economic impacts when deciding to protect species.  <br/><br/>However, while the proposed rule restores some pieces of the Endangered Species Act regulations, it is wholly inadequate and represents a huge missed opportunity to make meaningful progress to recover our most vulnerable animals and plants on the 50th anniversary of the Act_s passage.  <br/> <br/>With time running out, we can_t afford more of the status quo. Combating the global wildlife extinction crisis will require the Services to be bolder and more visionary than any other administration in history. For these reasons, I urge the Services to not only rescind the Trump-era rollbacks in their entirety, but to also strengthen the implementation of the Endangered Species Act to avert the extinction crisis and curtail the ongoing loss of biodiversity in the United States and around the world.

INFO - Comment: Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers. <br/><br/>The ATF’s proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized. <br/><br/>1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale—or no sale at all—might require a license:<br/><br/>ATF’s rule claims that the agency has opted not to "establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year" that require licensure, and instead suggests that "even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."<br/>However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who "regular[ly]" and "repetitive[ly]" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple "firearms." <br/><br/>2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:<br/><br/>Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted "occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby." According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be "engaged in the business" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF’s rule provides no such assurances.<br/><br/>3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:<br/><br/>Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer—private gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court’s Caniglia decision in 2021. <br/><br/>In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called "welfare check." But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police—and the Biden administration—with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.<br/><br/>4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:<br/><br/>One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have "willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license." Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior. <br/><br/>Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF’s footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don’t! <br/><br/>5. ATF’s backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration: <br/><br/>So-called "Universal Background Checks" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime. <br/><br/>The Biden Administration described this as "moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation." And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales. <br/><br/>But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.

We are calling on you to urgently create a strong, lasting national rule that protects mature and old-growth trees and forests across federal lands from the threat of logging. Protecting and recovering these natural climate solutions would be a crucial piece of U.S. climate policy.  <br/><br/>Safeguarding and expanding carbon-rich forests on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands is one of the most important, cost-effective, and timely approaches to fighting the climate crisis. Mature trees store and continue to absorb large amounts of carbon in addition to providing the public with clean drinking water, habitat for imperiled wildlife, and world-class recreational opportunities. Larger, older trees are also far more fire resistant, and a well-constructed rule would not preclude necessary, science-based efforts to address the risk of fire.   <br/><br/>Unfortunately, vital mature forests and trees on federal lands are currently threatened by numerous proposed and ongoing logging projects, in spite of President Biden’s executive order to conserve them. We need to ensure America's mature and old-growth trees and forests remain in place to mitigate climate change, and to maintain their natural benefits for future generations.

Please remove sterilization and prescription contraceptives from the list of "preventive services" the federal government is mandating in private health plans.  It is especially important to exclude any drug that may cause an early abortion, and to fully respect religious freedom as other federal laws do.  The narrow religious exemption in HHS's new rule protects almost no one. I urge you to allow all organizations and individuals to offer, sponsor and obtain health coverage that does not violate their moral and religious convictions.

INFO - Comment: Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment on the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding allocated to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). As an alfalfa farmer, I am requesting NRCS incentivize the use and integration of alfalfa in NRCS programs to capitalize on the unique environmental and conservation benefits it brings to the agricultural landscape.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Earlier this year, the House and Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee report language recognized alfalfa as a ‘climate-smart’ commodity with exceptional capacity for carbon sequestration and decreased reliance on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Alfalfa has many benefits: as a perennial crop, it offers unique opportunities for carbon sequestration in its extensive deep-rooted system; it requires less tillage and builds soil organic matter; it reduces erosion; it has been shown to produce much less methane in ruminant animal digestion, as opposed to feeding higher grain diets; it is a leguminous plant that utilizes ‘free’ nitrogen from the atmosphere and does not require additional nitrogen fertilizers which are carbon intensive. And yet, NRCS has virtually overlooked the nation’s 4th most valuable field crop when developing its conservation programs. THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Programs such as Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP); Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP); and Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) are just a few of the many NRCS programs through which to encourage greater utilization of alfalfa to capture these important environmental benefits.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>I applaud your effort to gather public comment on this important issue and strongly encourage you to work in partnership with alfalfa farmers and alfalfa organizations to develop programs capitalizing on alfalfa’s unique environmental benefits as you implement programs under IRA to fund the deployment of climate-smart practices.<br/><br/>

INFO - Comment: The FDA needs to prioritize the public's health and safety and ban the cancer-causing swine drug carbadox. <br/><br/>To ensure consumer and food worker safety as well as protect the environment, pigs should not be given carbadox. Use of the drug creates dangerous residues in food products and results in residues of carbadox and its metabolites in surface waters in states with large numbers of pig producing facilities. <br/><br/>I depend upon the FDA to ensure my food is healthy to eat. Since at least 2003, the FDA has recognized that the use of carbadox in pigs puts consumers at risk of carcinogenic residues. The international standard setting body Codex Alimentarius found that there is no safe level of residues of carbadox or its metabolites in food that represents an acceptable risk to consumers. Currently, there is no approved and adequate method for detecting residues, and this puts the public at risk. FDA should withdraw the approval immediately in order to protect public health.

INFO - Comment: Thank you for issuing this strong guidance that recognizes the real impacts of producing hydrogen and clarifies which hydrogen projects will be eligible for the 45V tax credit established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The draft guidance avoids wasting billions of tax dollars on subsidies for dirty hydrogen production projects that would spike climate and health-harming pollution.  <br/><br/>Hydrogen produced by fossil fuels is never a climate solution and tax credits should only go to hydrogen projects that are truly clean. Clean hydrogen production must meet three key requirements: Electrolysis must be powered by clean electricity that is 1) drawn from newly built carbon-free sources, 2) physically deliverable to the electrolysis facility, and 3) matched hourly with the electrolyzer’s power consumption. <br/><br/>The Biden administration must account for the full harms of producing hydrogen from methane, but its current modeling assumptions undercount climate pollution from the methane gas industry. The administration must also reject schemes that would reward polluters for creating more methane or allow the fossil fuel industry to greenwash its methane with biogas credits.  <br/><br/>The Inflation Reduction Act represents the single biggest federal effort to combat the global climate crisis, but its success greatly depends on how this administration implements it. We urge your agency to finalize strong guidance that will drive taxpayer dollars towards projects that do not exacerbate climate pollution from power plants or spur more fossil gas drilling.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Moya Mosher<br/>Columbia, SC

INFO - Comment: Dear U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  <br/><br/>I urge you to finalize Endangered Species Act protection for monarch butterflies without delay. The science is clear: Migratory monarch populations are facing extinction. Safeguards are urgently needed to rebuild monarch numbers because these once-common butterflies have drastically declined and now need our help to survive. <br/><br/>Protection for these beloved butterflies is warranted because of growing threats from climate change, logging of their winter habitat in Mexico and California, pesticides, ongoing loss of milkweed and wildflowers to sprawl development, and disease.  <br/><br/>Monarch protections should include safeguards from pesticides, especially insecticides that are particularly harmful to pollinators. The Endangered Species Act listing should protect monarchs from commercial sale because mass-reared monarchs threaten the health of wild populations. The listing should identify measures to prevent the import of avocados grown on illegally deforested lands in monarchs’ winter habitat.  <br/><br/>Monarchs also need a comprehensive recovery plan, conservation funding, and critical habitat designation. I support the proposal to protect their overwintering habitat in California. But eastern monarchs also need critical habitat, especially along their migratory corridors. The Service should include national wildlife refuges and other federal lands in critical habitat for eastern monarchs so that they have designated protected areas to complete their migratory journeys. <br/><br/>Monarchs are culturally significant across North America. Generations of students have learned about metamorphosis by watching their amazing lifecycle. Please make sure these orange-and-black beauties survive for future generations by finalizing their protection.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Caephren McKenna<br/>CA 94609

INFO - Comment: I am writing to urge the National Marine Fisheries Service to immediately enforce the Marine Mammal Protection Act Section 101 by banning swordfish imports until exporting countries demonstrate that their swordfish catch meets U.S. standards for protecting marine mammals.  This 36-year-old law protects dozens of species of dolphins, porpoises, sea lions, whales, and other species I care about while safeguarding U.S. fishers from unfair competition with unregulated foreign fishing fleets.  The time is long overdue to enforce the law and ban swordfish imports.<br/><br/>Congress recognized that fishing posed a threat to marine mammal species when it passed this provision of the Marine Mammal Protection Act over 30 years ago.  Enforcement of Marine Mammal Protection Act provisions for U.S. fisheries has led to the establishment of significant protective measures aimed at restricting harmful fishing practices and protecting marine mammal populations from unsustainable fisheries bycatch.  Congress also recognized that, if the United States' efforts to protect marine mammals from fisheries bycatch were to be successful, it would have to exert pressure on fisheries of other nations to adopt similarly protective measures.<br/><br/>The Marine Mammal Protection Act requires that all fisheries meet a "zero mortality rate goal" - in other words, that they reduce incidental death and serious injury of marine mammals to as close to zero as possible. This requirement has led to a number of important regulations on U.S. fishing, including gear-based requirements such as the use of pingers and net extenders, limits on the length of longlines, and as other measures like time-area closures, safe handling and release training and equipment, and mandatory observer coverage. All of these measures play a vital role in reducing fisheries' impact on populations of marine mammals and other species.<br/><br/>Banning swordfish imports until source countries demonstrate that they meet these important standards would use U.S. market power to protect marine species I care about around the world and protect the economic interests of domestic fisheries. Therefore, I strongly urge the National Marine Fisheries Service to implement the ban immediately. Thank you for your attention to this important issue.

INFO - Comment: Dear Tom Vilsack,<br/><br/>I am writing to voice my support for the USDA’s proposal to strengthen nutrition standards for school meals. Building on the historic progress of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, this rule proposes limiting added sugars in school meals for the very first time. School meals that are limited in added sugars and sodium and contain whole grains can help introduce healthy eating habits and can help mitigate chronic health conditions.  <br/><br/>Added Sugars: School breakfasts are far too sugary, and I applaud the USDA’s proposed cap of no more than 10 percent of calories from added sugars, which mirrors the Dietary Guidelines recommendation. I also support USDA’s product-specific added sugars limits.   <br/><br/>Sodium: While these sodium reduction goals represent progress, the final limits do not go far enough and are out of alignment with the Dietary Guidelines’ quantitative recommendations. For instance, children up to age 8 will get 83 percent of their daily recommended sodium limit from breakfast and lunch combined, leaving just 17 percent leftover for snacks and dinner. A 13-year-old will get 77 percent of their daily limit from school breakfast and lunch, and high school students will get 63 percent.  <br/><br/>Whole Grains: The two options proposed by the USDA require less than half of grains offered be whole, which is not aligned with the Dietary Guidelines’ recommendations. I encourage the USDA to strengthen the whole grain-rich requirement. <br/><br/>Healthy, wholesome meals provide children the nutrients they need to grow, develop and learn in and out of the classroom, and the 30 million kids who rely on school meals every day deserve better. It’s time to stop appeasing industry and put the health of kids first.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Joy Appleton<br/>Asheville, NC

Because CEQ’s action would reduce government transparency and harm people and the environment, I oppose the interim final rule and strongly urge CEQ to reconsider.<br/><br/>By requiring federal agencies to study the environmental and public health impacts of their actions and inform and involve the public, the National Environmental Policy Act is a critical tool to safeguard communities, wildlife, air, water and land. For over 40 years, CEQ’s rules implementing NEPA – particularly as updated and modernized in recent years – have ensured a stable, predictable, and science-based environmental review process and given affected communities a voice in agency decisions that impact their lives.<br/><br/>I have relied on the NEPA process, including its emphasis on transparent decision making and meaningful community involvement, to stay informed and have a say in government decisions that affect my community and our shared public lands and waters. <br/><br/>The approach taken by CEQ’s interim final rule is shortsighted, thwarts the important purposes of NEPA, and does a disservice to people and the environment. The interim final rule will likewise lead to increased uncertainty, delays, inefficiencies, and other unintended adverse consequences. I strongly urge CEQ to reverse course and resume the necessary work of ensuring that NEPA’s procedural requirements lead to informed decisions that are better for the environment and people, as intended by the statute.  <br/><br/>  Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Sarah Kilbourne<br/>735 Charlo St  Missoula, MT 59802-2715<br/>sarah.kilbourne@packraft.org

INFO - Comment: To Whom It May Concern:  <br/><br/>The Department of the Interior needs to finalize a serious oil and natural gas leasing program for the Gulf of Mexico. A few new lease sales are not enough to meet America’s energy needs in upcoming years. Interior needs to consistently offer the resources we have in order to help us avoid more painful inflation and energy shortages.   <br/><br/>The first step should be taking the option of no new lease sales in the next 5 years off the table.  Nearly 15% of America’s oil comes from the Gulf, and no new lease sales in 5 years means that by 2036 we could be losing out on hundreds of thousands of barrels per day. This is not going to help contain the cost of energy in the future and will make it even harder for American energy producers to meet our country’s needs.   <br/><br/>Responsible resource management means planning for the future, and a final leasing program that does not include any offshore lease sales does not do that. It can already take over 10 years to develop a new oil prospect in the Gulf—why would we want to make that process even harder? As global events have shown, America still has a need for energy independence and robust domestic supplies of natural gas and oil. It would be irresponsible to ignore those now.   <br/><br/>I hope that you take this opportunity to help set America’s energy future on a strong and promising track. We need to be investing in our own natural potential, not continuing to rely on other countries for the energy we need. Moving forward with all current pending lease sales, and making a robust plan for continuing them, is how we make that world a reality.

INFO - Comment: I’m writing to ask you to stop moving forward with an ecologically-destructive land swap and road slicing through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge that is likely to cause irreparable harm to many Alaska Native Tribes. <br/><br/>Alaska Native people in Western Alaska depend on Pacific brant and emperor geese to feed their families, support their culture, and sustain their health. These species in turn rely on the health of Izembek for crucial portions of their life cycle.  The proposed project seems quite likely to cause irreparable harm to these species and population level impacts could result. Indeed, based on your agency’s own findings, these birds would suffer major cumulative impacts from a land exchange and road. The supplemental draft EIS acknowledges greater impacts to these species under the agency’s preferred alternative compared to other alternatives, along with an increased risk of population level impacts. If these birds suffer population level declines, the harm to the Native Village of Hooper Bay and other tribes is likely to be severe and irreparable.  <br/><br/>Before making this decision, Secretary Haaland noted that respecting tribal sovereignty required listening to tribal communities. In making this decision, however, Sec. Haaland met only with the people of King Cove.  The Secretary has turned a deaf ear to dozens of Alaska tribes, including the Native Village of Hooper Bay, who repeatedly voiced opposition to the road and asked for the environmental study to be halted, and who seeks a reasonable compromise that would meet the stated need of the project and the people of King Cove, while avoiding irreparable harm to Western Alaska tribes..  <br/><br/>Please withdraw this project all together or, if you must move forward, choose the no action alternative because there are other viable options that will not result in irreparable harm to tribal communities in Western Alaska.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Elaine Lailas<br/>Miami, FL

INFO - Comment: <br/><br/> <br/><br/>As a resident of New Jersey, I'm very disappointed to learn that the Food and Drug Administration is considering severe sales restrictions on many of the most popular cigars sold in the U.S. Keep in mind that many adult cigar smokers prefer flavored cigars. These potential restrictions on cigars disregard adult freedom, and are just another attempt to tell adults what they can and cannot do. Please do not move forward with restrictions that would ban flavored cigars.<br/><br/>Banning the sale of flavored cigars is a classic example of the government overstepping its authority by targeting adult cigar smokers with excessive, overly restrictive regulations. Reasonable regulations are one thing---but this is government overreach that takes away adult choices.<br/><br/>We can all agree reasonable regulations that help keep flavored cigars away from kids make sense. Banning the sale of flavored cigars to adults does not.<br/><br/>In the end, this isn't about flavors. It's about limiting adult choices. Please do not unfairly limit the choices available to adult cigar smokers by imposing such extreme, overreaching restrictions on flavored cigar sales.

INFO - Comment: As an adult tobacco consumer and a resident of Missouri, I am writing to oppose the ban on menthol cigarettes. Please do not move forward with this proposal that will repeat the same mistakes of prohibition of alcohol and cannabis. <br/><br/>Banning menthol cigarettes unfairly limits adult choices for tobacco products that are already highly regulated and age-restricted. Youth usage rates of cigarettes are the lowest in a generation.  Adult tobacco consumers 21+ should be allowed to buy menthol cigarettes if they want to.<br/><br/>This proposed ban could create an illegal market outside of all regulatory controls, including effective measures to keep tobacco products away from kids. If this ban takes effect, selling once legal products will suddenly become criminal activity.   History tells us that bans don't work.  Effective regulation and education are better solutions than creating illegal markets and increasing crime.<br/><br/>Please do not ban the sale of menthol cigarettes in the United States.  I ask you to consider other solutions before prohibiting any products.

INFO - Comment: National Marine Fisheries Service    Dear National Marine Fisheries Service,  I'm deeply concerned about the impact of your agency's fishery management decisions on ocean ecosystems. I believe that strong environmental review is critical to the health of our oceans. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has made it possible to protect thousands of square miles of deep sea coral formations, save the lives of endangered sea turtles and begin rebuilding of depleted fish populations.   Unfortunately your agency's proposed NEPA rule hands over too much authority to fishery management councils that have a long history of poor management, significantly limits the public's ability to participate in fishery management decisions, and allows fishery managers to make decisions about fishing without fully considering the impacts on marine ecosystems including sea turtles, seals, corals and other precious ocean life.  Please withdraw this flawed NEPA proposal and craft a new one that will ensure protection of our ocean ecosystems. Our oceans are in trouble. I've seen in my own life how decades of mismanagement have degraded the oceans. It's time for our nation's fisheries managers to make better decisions by fully understanding the consequences of fishing on marine ecosystems.   Thank you for your time and consideration.

INFO - Comment: Thank you for the opportunity to comment on BOEM's Request for Information on the preparation of the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. As someone who cares deeply about protecting our country's precious ocean ecosystems, I am very concerned about the prospect of leasing for oil and gas development off the US Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf, and Alaskan coasts. Opening these areas to offshore oil and gas drilling poses a direct threat to the fragile and unique marine animals who rely on clean oceans and beaches to survive.<br/><br/>As the Deepwater Horizon disaster showed 15 years ago, there is no such thing as safe offshore drilling, nor is there a way to fully clean up a significant spill. Keeping oil rigs out of the ocean prevents unnecessary harm to sensitive marine animals such as sea turtles, whales, and seabirds, and avoids the massive costs associated with environmental remediation when things inevitably go wrong.<br/><br/>Even in the absence of major spills, routine leaks and accidents can threaten the clean ocean environment. Drilling--and the associated industrial impacts--are entirely incompatible with the special marine ecosystems found off our coasts. Ocean species, from walruses and beluga whales in the Arctic, to sea turtles and manatees in the Southeast, deserve better.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I urge you to abandon the plan to pursue oil and gas drilling off our coasts.

INFO - Comment: I staunchly support the implementation of the USDA's proposed Organic Livestock & Poultry Standards rule. This set of requirements for the raising of chickens, turkeys, pigs, cows, sheep and other livestock on organic farms would vastly improve welfare for those animals, making sure they have meaningful access to the outdoors and the ability to engage in natural behaviors. It also ensures animals are not subject to certain unnecessary and painful mutilations and have more protections at the end of their lives during transport and at slaughter. <br/><br/>Importantly, the rule would align practices on organic farms with consumer expectations. Studies show that concern for animal welfare is one of the top reasons consumers choose organic meat, milk, cheese and eggs, and most assume the organic program ensures animals have meaningful access to the outdoors. Consumers consistently report that they're willing to pay more for higher-welfare products. It is well past time to ensure that consumers are receiving the higher welfare-products they're seeking when they buy organic.<br/><br/>I thank the USDA for proposing this rule and urge the agency to swiftly advance a final rule that will require organic producers to start complying with these improved standards as quickly as possible.

INFO - Comment: Dear Mr. Michael Barnette,<br/><br/>I urge NMFS to expand the requirement to use turtle excluder devices (TEDs) on shrimp trawl vessels in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean to include all vessels using skimmer trawls, pusher-head trawls, and wing nets. NMFS originally proposed to require TEDs on all of these vessels in 2016, based on its analysis of the need to protect threatened and endangered sea turtles and years of data showing that TEDs are effective, inexpensive, and safe for shrimping vessels to use. More recent data only underscores the need for and effectiveness of TEDs in saving turtles.  <br/><br/>Every year, the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic shrimp fleets needlessly kill thousands of threatened and endangered sea turtles. Turtles get swept into shrimp nets along with many other non-target species. Without TEDs to give them a chance to escape, these turtles cannot surface to breathe, and thus suffer substantial injury or—for too many—drowning. The Endangered Species Act requires your agency to prevent harm and actively promote the recovery of these beleaguered species. It is unacceptable that NMFS continues to allow a substantial portion of the shrimp fleets to operate without simple, effective technology that could prevent thousands of turtles from dying in shrimp nets. <br/><br/>Please end this senseless slaughter by immediately promulgating regulations that require all shrimp vessels in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Ocean to use TEDs, and ensuring those regulations go into effect shortly after they are promulgated. Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Melissa Sprouse<br/>Carthage, NC 28327

INFO - Comment: Dear Social Security Commissioner Saul:<br/><br/>I am writing about the proposed Social Security rule that would make most people getting disability benefits prove that they have disabilities every two years.  I am very worried about the rule.  I do not think it should go forward.<br/><br/>It can be very hard to get disability benefits.  For some people it takes years, and it is a stressful and time consuming process.  More frequent disability reviews will create additional burdens for people with disabilities who cannot work and are struggling with income insecurity.<br/><br/>Even worse, Social Security often makes mistakes when reviewing disability, meaning there is an even greater chance that people who qualify for benefits will be denied and will go without the help they need.  And pushing more people into disability reviews will slow down the system for everyone.<br/><br/>The new rule will put more than two million people at risk of losing benefits over the next 10 years.  This rule would hurt people with disabilities. Having to prove that I'm disabled is already an overwhelming process. If I were to have to do so every two years, that would cause me a lot of stress. I have friends that are and have been homeless. They have difficulty getting mail. If they miss the letter notifying them of their recertification, they could lose their only source of income. It would make them vulnerable to homelessness again. They wouldn't be able to get food. It could further flood the already crowded shelter systems and put even more vulnerable people on the streets. Please do not go forward with the rule.

INFO - Comment: Please consider my comments below as part of the record on docket number CEQ20230002.<br/><br/>The Snake and Columbia Rivers once produced the largest runs of salmon and steelhead in the world.  These once abundant runs sustained Indigenous people for millennia and remain critical to their culture and lifeways.  These salmon runs are also critical to equally endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales of the Northwest.  Both species now swim at the brink of extinction.  The dams on the lower Snake River were the primary blow to these runs, which, though diminished, still returned by the millions just prior to them being constructed.  It is time to correct this historic mistake.  The report and recommendations by Senator Murray and Governor Inslee last year demonstrated we could responsibly replace the services of these dams and that we must move forward to do so and prepare to breach the dams. The NOAA Fisheries Rebuilding Report made clear that breaching the lower Snake River dams must be a central element in any successful plan to restore Columbia Basin salmon.<br/><br/>The lower Snake River dams must be breached, and the services replaced, if we are to avoid extinction and recover once abundant salmon runs of salmon and steelhead. The "Lower Snake River Dams: Benefit Replacement Report showed the way forward.  We must move quickly down that path in a time frame that works for the salmon and respects our commitments to tribal nations. Governor Inslee proposed, and the Washington State legislature approved, funding to take the next steps in planning for replacing these services.  The Biden Administration must build on this forward leaning action to advance dam removal and investments in replacing their services.  The administration must commit to a supplemental EIS that provides the foundation and process for moving forward a comprehensive salmon recovery plan that includes breaching the lower Snake River dams.<br/><br/>We must keep faith and honor our commitments to tribal nations to protect and restore abundant salmon runs.  This should also include reintroducing salmon in the Upper Columbia Basin using the Upper Columbia River Tribes reintroduction plan.<br/><br/>We have options to replace the energy, irrigation, and transportation services provided by the lower Snake River dams.  Extinction is forever.  We are running out of time.  The Biden Administration must be the catalyst to restoring the river, replacing the services of the dams, and bringing back abundant salmon for Tribes, communities and a heritage that belongs to all of us.

INFO - Comment: I am opposed to any regulation on bump stocks.<br/><br/>These proposed regulations would declare a "bump stock" to be a machinegun because it allows the gun to fire more than one shot "by a single PULL of the trigger" -- that is, by a single volitional function of the finger.<br/>But federal law, at 26 U.S.C. 5845(b), defines a part as a "machinegun" ONLY if it is designed solely and exclusively to allow the gun to "fire more than one shot ... by a single FUNCTION of the trigger."<br/>To state the obvious, a finger is not the same thing as a trigger. And, while a bump stock is in operation, the trigger functions separately every time a round is discharged.<br/>So these regulations are proposing a radical change -- as they effectively define a gun as a machinegun even if the trigger resets for every round that is fired, so long as the finger only pulls the trigger once.<br/>While bump stock devices will now be treated as machineguns under these regulations, they also raise serious questions in regard to AR-15s and other semi-automatic rifles -- as they are now on the brink of being designated as machineguns by the next anti-gun administration.<br/>In the past, one had to fundamentally change the firing mechanism of a semi-automatic firearm to convert it into a fully automatic firearm.<br/>But now according to these regulations, a bump stock is a machinegun -- and it can "readily restore" a semi-auto into a machinegun, simply because the gun owner can effectively fire the weapon continuously with a "single pull" of the trigger. This would invoke the statutory definition for a rifle, which is classified as a machinegun (26 USC 5845(b)).<br/>It won't matter that a gun which is being bump fired has not been fundamentally altered.  AR-15s will be on the brink of extinction once these regulations go into force.<br/>These regulations dismiss Second Amendment protections, by appealing to the Heller court decision. But the Constitution trumps the Supreme Court -- so when the Second Amendment says that the right to keep and bear arms "shall not be infringed," any limitation of the right for law-abiding citizens should be treated as unconstitutional.

Also referred to as the Public Lands Rule, the Bureau of Land Management's interest in establishing parity for conservation with various other uses of our public lands is a critical move for achieving real balance in management.<br/><br/>Given that the BLM is the steward of our largest public lands estate, managing more than 245 million acres, the result of this rulemaking process would greatly benefit hunters and anglers who rely on healthy, intact landscapes to pursue fish and game. Valuing conservation of intact habitat - including migration corridors - on par with other uses provides an unparalleled opportunity for the BLM at a time when intense drought, severe wildfires and encroaching invasive species threaten our public lands.<br/><br/>As proposed, this rule would promote critical restoration work by utilizing conservation leasing, a new tool for BLM to manage healthy public lands and accommodate more novel mitigation approaches. Targeted conservation leasing could help restore degraded and fragmented landscapes, increasing their resilience and improving the connectivity of migratory corridors.<br/><br/>I want to thank the BLM for its commitment to improving the management of our public lands and waters through this proposed rule, which will improve the conservation of fish and wildlife habitat for the benefit of hunters and anglers.

The rule would reverse existing U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service policy that favors establishing critical habitat on federal land, the land owned by all of us. This about face on policy will hurt species that depend on federal lands, like the polar bear, northern spotted owl, and the Gunnison sage grouse. I fear that this change is intended to help those that would exploit and damage federal lands, like loggers and drillers, at the expense of imperiled species and our planets biodiversity. <br/><br/>The proposal would also tip the scales on cost-benefit analysis, giving much more weight to costs to extractive and harmful industries, while ignoring the benefits to species. We know that when we save nature, we save ecosystem services, we protect our environment and our health, and we protect future generations. And yet, this rule would put the immediate economic costs of just a handful of individuals and corporations ahead of all that  including my family and my community. I do not agree with this change and I urge you to withdraw this proposal. <br/><br/>Habitat loss is the biggest threat to imperiled species, which means critical habitat designations are one of the most important protections we can preserve for species on the brink of extinction. There are a million species at risk of extinction, and we should be doing all we can to save them, instead of undermining the ESA. This proposed rule will weaken our ability to protect species, and for that reason I oppose this proposed rule and urge you to withdraw it.

INFO - Comment: This policy has far-reaching implications for students in schools and colleges. It appears that the real discrimination would actually be against those who are functioning as biological males and females. Where are their rights to a safe learning environment? Expanding the intent of Title IX is a gross misinterpretation of protection against youth, especially females. It is a slippery slope to make these changes, especially when we are considering young people’s right to privacy in bathrooms, locker rooms and shower facilities. I am strongly opposed to this new policy.

INFO - Comment: As a member of the American Society of Radiologic Technologists, I respectfully submit public comment to the Office of Management and Budget to consider updating the classification of diagnostic radiologic technologists to professional under 29-2030.  <br/><br/>Radiologic technologists work at the intersection of innovation in medical technology and direct patient care. This requires us to exercise critical thinking daily, not only as part of a larger health care delivery team but also individually when deciding how best to provide care based on each patient’s particular needs. <br/><br/>Radiologic technologists are similar in a broad sense to a variety of other health care workers who are required to exercise critical thinking and independent judgment as part of their daily jobs. The job of the radiologic technologist involves operating imaging equipment to capture images of a patient’s internal body structures and troubleshooting systems to ensure diagnostic-quality images. They collaborate with radiologists, ensuring that diagnostic-quality images are captured through the appropriate imaging modality. For example, a technologist must use certain imaging techniques for a trauma patient to assure safe imaging and accurate diagnosis.  Capturing elbow images that allow for diagnosis on a patient who walks in is quite different than capturing images for a patient with significant trauma. Radiologic technologists work autonomously to use their knowledge, tools and critical thinking skills to capture diagnostic images. If images are not diagnostic, the radiologist may miss a diagnosis. Radiologic technologists must enforce strict radiation protocols throughout their work, and they have a critical role in patient care: providing instructions to patients and ensuring patients are comfortable and safe during procedures.   <br/><br/>The role of the radiologic technologist in the modern health care industry continues to evolve as the demand for improved imaging technology accelerates. This has made radiologic technologists more essential and has required more specialization. Therefore, I believe it appropriate that the SOC occupational definition for radiologic technologists be reconsidered to more accurately reflect the increasingly professional responsibilities of this occupation. Additionally, technologists’ therapy counterparts, radiation therapists, are already classified as professionals, and they ensure a similar level of patient management and critical thinking as radiologic technologists every day. <br/><br/>I urge the OMB to take this opportunity to revise the SOC occupational definitions to provide important updates to the radiologic technologist definition that reflect the growing importance of the profession. I urge the OMB to update definition to more clearly designates the radiologic technologist as a professional. This would more accurately reflect the actual practice of this vital health care role and ensure that this profession is properly characterized. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to present these comments for the OMB’s possible revision of the SOC for 2028.

INFO - Title: Comment from Raslavsky, Robert
INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Debra Haaland,<br/><br/>I am writing to you today to express my opposition to Gulf-wide leasing in the oil and gas lease sales 259 and 261. <br/><br/>The Inflation Reduction Act does not require the administration to lease the entire Western and Central Gulf. Nor does it mandate any particular results from those sales. Rather, Congress, through both the IRA and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, empowered Interior to determine the size, location, and conditions for offshore leasing sales and preserved Interior’s authority to decide whether to issue a lease. And BOEM has the obligation to make those decisions based on a full evaluation of the environmental effects that leasing will cause – including climate pollution, oil spills, and harms to the critically endangered Rice’s whale. <br/><br/>There is simply no need for BOEM to continue with the large-scale lease sales we saw for four years under the Trump administration. Oil companies currently hold close to 1,900 leases covering more than 10 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico. Only about 500 of those leases are currently in production, meeting the current demand for offshore oil and gas and leaving more than 7.4 million leased acres (or 75% of current lease holdings) remaining to be developed to meet any near or mid-term national energy needs. <br/><br/>Moreover, massive area-wide lease sales are fundamentally incompatible with the Biden administration’s commitments to fight climate change. Decisions we make now about additional leases have no effect on current or even near-term energy needs because new leases typically take a decade to produce any oil. And because of the long-term nature of oil and gas development, leasing now locks in investments in fossil fuels for decades to come, long after the time when the United States and the world must transition to a clean energy economy if we are to avoid the more catastrophic impacts of climate change.   <br/><br/>Finally, continuing with massive leases sales increases the already dire harm to Gulf wildlife – like the 50 remaining critically endangered Rice’s whale – and to Gulf communities, which have disproportionately borne the brunt of the country’s fossil fuel addiction for far too long. Locking in new leases means locking in continued harm for decades to come and will only slow the needed rapid phase-out of fossil fuel from the nation’s energy portfolio.   <br/><br/>I urge you to not sell off millions of acres of Gulf leases and to use your authority and ample discretion to instead accelerate the rapid transition to the clean energy future the country needs!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Robert Raslavsky<br/>North Brookfield, MA 01535

INFO - Comment: Dear David Bernhart,<br/><br/>I am writing to you today in support of the proposal to set a year-round 10-knot vessel speed restriction in parts of the Gulf of Mexico to protect the endangered Rice’s whale from collisions and noise pollution. <br/><br/>Fossil fuel exploration development and other human activities have made the Rice’s whale one of the most endangered large whale species in the world. Your own scientists have concluded that the death of even a single reproductive-age female would jeopardize the existence of this species.  <br/><br/>So, any way to mitigate risks to these whales’ survival should be implemented immediately.  This includes mandatory speed limits and other reasonable measures governing vessel traffic within the whales’ habitat:  <br/><br/>** a mandatory 10-knot speed limit; <br/>** no vessel transits at night; <br/>** utilize visual observers and maintain a separation distance of 500 m from Rice's whales; <br/>** use and operate an Automatic Identification System, or notify NMFS of transits through the habitat;  <br/>** and report deviations from these requirements to NMFS. <br/><br/>Based on the latest science showing that these whales are persistently found in waters 100-400 meters deep all the way to the U.S.-Mexico border, these measures are needed not only within the whales’ previously identified “core habitat,” but throughout the Gulf.  Slowing down for Gulf of Mexico whales is a key step and only one part of the protection that is needed. These whales can recover as long as conditions improve, but that all depends on our actions. Unless the Biden administration takes significant conservation actions, the U.S. is likely to cause the first extinction of a great whale species resulting from human activity. We cannot let that happen.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>James Franzi<br/>Fiddletown, CA 95629

The proposed rule by the U.S. Department of Education would completely undermine Title IX’s requirement to establish and maintain a level playing field for women and girls in athletics.  Congress passed Title IX to ensure that educational institutions preserve and protect athletic opportunities for women and girls. By proposing to extend Title IX to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity, the administration’s proposed rule would force school districts, colleges, and universities to allow biological males who identify as female to compete in women’s sports. The administration’s proposed rewrite of Title IX undermines this important law.  Title IX has been instrumental in ensuring that girls and women across the United States have equal opportunities in athletics.  Allowing biological men who identify as female to play on women’s sports teams will cause women to lose positions on athletic teams and opportunities to compete, prizes, and scholarships, as well as risk bodily harm in certain sports. The Biden Education Department’s proposed rule would take those opportunities away for millions of women and girls and place them at risk of physical injury. Please withdraw this rule and enforce Title IX as Congress intended.

INFO - Comment: Director Alan Risenhoover Office of Sustainable Fisheries, NMFS 1315 East-West Highway Silver Spring, MD 20910  Dear Director,  I am a concerned citizen deeply worried about the impact of your agency's fishery management decisions on ocean ecosystems. I am especially concerned with impacts to seabirds and other wildlife.   Each year, tens of thousands of albatross and petrels are killed in longlines. These fishing practices can be easily changed to reduce the mortality to these birds -- some of which are endangered. This is just one example of how fishery management is not only destroying resources below the seas, as fisheries collapse, but also are impacting other species that are tied to ocean systems.  Now there is a proposal to weaken public participation in decisions that affect oceans by taking the National Environmental Policy Act out of the equation and replacing it with a process that is totally inadequate.  I believe that strong environmental review is critical to the health of our oceans. Citizens must have a voice in how public resources are managed. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has made it possible to protect thousands of square miles of deep sea coral formations, save the lives of endangered sea turtles and seabirds, and begin rebuilding of depleted fish populations. It must continue to have a role in fishery management.   Unfortunately the National Marine Fisheries Agency's proposed NEPA rule hands over too much authority to fishery management councils that have a long history of poor management, significantly limits the public's ability to participate in fishery management decisions, and allows fishery managers to make decisions about fishing without fully considering the impacts on seabirds, sea turtles, seals, corals and other precious ocean life.  Please withdraw this flawed NEPA proposal and craft a new one that will ensure protection of our ocean ecosystems. Our oceans are in trouble. I've seen in my own life how decades of mismanagement have degraded the oceans. It's time for our nation's fisheries managers to make better decisions by fully understanding the consequences of fishing on marine ecosystems.   Thank you for your time and consideration.

Ninety-nine percent of listed species have been saved from extinction, including iconic species such as the bald eagle. The law is also widely popular; polling shows that 90 percent of voters across the political spectrum support the law. The proposed changes to the statute will weaken the law and put thousands of plants and animal species at risk. <br/><br/>Proposed changes will allow federal agencies to not acknowledge the broad consequences of their actions through changes to the consultation requirements of Section 7 of the Act. Section 7 consultations require that a federal agency that is funding, authorizing, or conducting an activity to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service to ensure that the activity does not jeopardize the existence of endangered or threatened species or destroy their critical habitat. The proposed changes will reduce the effects of agency actions required to undergo consultations. For example, the proposed rule seeks comment on changes that would stop consultation for effects like climate change that are manifested through global processes. The changes proposed will also make it harder to protect critical habitat that is being impacted by development. The protection of even small sections of habitat is crucial for species conservation. The proposed changes would allow death by a thousand cuts by ignoring impacts to species critical habitats unless they impacted the entire habitat at once.  If the mechanisms for enforcement of the protection of endangered and threatened species and their critical habitats are weakened, species will be put at greater risk. <br/><br/>I urge you not to move forward these proposed changes and leave the regulations to one of our most effective and popular conservation laws untouched. Please withdraw the proposed changes to section 7 (Interagency Cooperation) rule. CFR Citation: 50 CFR Part 402 / Docket ID: NOAA_FRDOC_0001

INFO - Comment: Dear Director Jane Norton,<br/><br/>The mission of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to put the health and well-being of the public first. But instead of working to ensure everyone has equal access to comprehensive and nondiscriminatory services, HHS is asking for suggestions on how to expand the use of religious beliefs to discriminate and deny patients health care.<br/>It is not the case that faith-based entities are facing barriers to participating in HHS programs. What some faith-based entities have identified as barriers are simply non-discrimination requirements, as well as laws and programs conditions that require the delivery of essential and medically necessary health care services. The non-discrimination requirements, laws, and program conditions are not barriers, but rather fundamental legal requirements from which there can be no "accommodation." <br/><br/>A health care provider's religious beliefs should never determine the care a patient receives, and patients should not have to fear that a health care provider will turn them away due to religious or moral beliefs. Yet, hospitals use religious beliefs to refuse to treat a woman seeking abortion, even when it is the standard of care; pharmacies cite religion to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions, and providers refuse to treat LGBTQ individuals simply because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. When these refusals happen, patients suffer harmful health consequences. The harms caused by refusals to provide care have a disproportionate impact on those who already face multiple barriers to care, including communities of color, LGBTQ individuals, people facing language barriers, and those struggling to make ends meet.<br/>HHS should not be looking for ways to make it easier for entities to let religion dictate patient care. Instead, HHS should follow its mission and commit to protect individual health and well-being. It should ensure that all entities participating in HHS programs adhere to federal nondiscrimination requirements and requirements to provide patients with evidence-based essential care. And HHS should seek ways to address the real discrimination that women, LGBTQ people, and others face  every day.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jane Wiley<br/>  Tampa, FL 33624

INFO - Comment: I support the proposed update to the Davis-Bacon Prevailing Wage rules. The changes are long overdue and will help ensure that construction workers earn fair pay and benefits for the hard work they do on federally assisted construction projects.<br/><br/>The proposed update will ensure that Davis-Bacon prevailing rates reflect actual wages paid to workers by restoring the three-step method for determining the prevailing wage. Under the current regulatory framework, over half of all Davis-Bacon rates reflect a watered-down average rate that is not representative of the market and becomes quickly out of date. <br/><br/>I urge the US Department of Labor to act quickly to finalize the proposed rule to ensure that construction workers on federally assited projects have strong wage protections.

INFO - Comment: I strongly oppose the proposal to roll back critical protections for brown bears and to allow the trapping of wildlife species without a federal permit on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. This regulatory change caters to a very small number of hunters and trappers at the expense of both wildlife conservation and the enjoyment of the refuge by all Americans. The US Fish and Wildlife Service should ensure that the wildlife species visitors come to see at the Kenai refuge are thriving, not disappearing. <br/><br/>The current proposals are intended solely to satisfy the interests of government officials in Alaska who want to permit unethical killing of brown bears and liberalize refuge trapping regulations; they are not mandated by federal law or required by any USFWS policy or directive. <br/><br/>According to a survey of visitors to Kenai National Wildlife Refuge in 2010-2011, only 4 percent of visitors participated in big game hunting during the previous year, with only 3 percent indicating that hunting was the primary activity that they participated in while visiting the refuge. In contrast, 57 percent of visitors reported participating in hiking, wildlife observation, and photography during their visit to the refuge. <br/><br/>Eliminating refuge oversight of trapping in Kenai, as well as allowing the baiting of brown bears, may please the relatively small number of people who hunt and trap on the refuge, but it is inconsistent with the interests of the majority of refuge visitors who engage in non-consumptive activities. It also may jeopardize the safety and enjoyment of the majority of refuge visitors if they were to inadvertently step on a trap or come into conflict with bears who have become acclimated to piles of human food. <br/><br/>Furthermore, we know how destructive the easing of hunting and trapping restrictions can be. The killing of bears over bait on adjacent state lands, a result of Alaska's rollbacks of bear hunting rules from 1995 to 2018, reduced bear populations so much that the USFWS had to institute emergency bear-hunting closures in Kenai in 2013-2014. History should be a lesson, and the USFWS should prioritize protecting wildlife and biodiversity.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I urge the USFWS to withdraw its proposal to allow bear baiting and trapping without a federal permit on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.

Addressing the impacts of industrial logging of old-growth forest is essential to healthy fish and wildlife habitat, fishing, hunting and outdoor recreation, and our ability to mitigate impacts of climate change. We support conserving and maintaining healthy and diverse fish and wildlife habitat, and the opportunities it provides on the Tongass National Forest.    The Tongass is one of the most productive wild salmon areas in the world, responsible for producing 25% of all wild salmon harvested along the west coast. It stores hundreds of millions of tons of carbon in its trees and soils, more than 10% of all the carbon stored in U.S. forests.?Large-scale old-growth logging harms fish and wildlife habitat spoils the region's beautiful scenery and reduces the forest's ability to store carbon and mitigate effects of climate change. This negatively effects the amount and diversity of fish and wildlife populations, which reduces the opportunity for the hundreds of thousands of anglers, hunters, and outdoor enthusiasts who enjoy the benefits of the Tongass, and limits economic opportunity in the region's fishing and tourism industries.    As individuals and businesses that depend on these abundant natural resources, we support the USDA's and Forest Service's new strategy and thank you for bringing the Tongass in alignment with the needs of the public, our local economy, and our important fish and wildlife resources.

INFO - Comment: Please accept my comments on BLM’s proposed Public Lands Rule.<br/><br/>• The rule encourages designating additional Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) on public lands, which I support.<br/><br/>• The rule would set up a “conservation leasing” system that allows private parties to lease public lands for conservation and restoration purposes. In reality, it doesn’t appear the rule will achieve any such benefit. Since the rule requires that conservation leases must allow all ongoing activities to continue—even if they are destructive uses like livestock grazing—any benefit from restoration that might accrue from the lease would be seriously diminished.<br/><br/>• Wilderness areas should be exempt from the conservation leasing program. Leasing public lands for any purpose commodifies those lands—since commercial enterprise is generally banned in Wilderness, leasing Wilderness for any purpose would likely violate the Wilderness Act.<br/><br/>• The conservation leases put a heavy emphasis on active intervention, manipulation, and restoration. Such heavy-handed management runs counter to the fundamental tenet of the Wilderness Act to let nature be, so the intended management of the leased lands poses a risk to Wilderness. This is yet another reason Wilderness areas should be off-limits for conservation leases.<br/><br/>• BLM should unequivocally state in the new rule that the overarching mandate for wilderness stewardship is to preserve each area’s "untrammeled" or "wild" character.<br/><br/>• In lieu of conservation leases in Wilderness, there should be a mechanism for permanent retirement of grazing permits in Wilderness and other sensitive areas. At a minimum, there should also be a non-use status for 10 years of grazing allotments in Wilderness that do not meet land health standards. It would be preferable for the permits to be revoked until recovery occurs.

General Todd Semonite,<br/><br/>On behalf of the Massachusetts Rivers Alliance, I wish to express our strong opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers' (Corps) proposal to repeal the 2015 Clean Water Rule. This Rule was carefully developed to protect our nation's waters and a repeal of this Rule would jeopardize the health and safety of our streams, rivers and wetlands. <br/><br/>The Clean Water Rule is a strong, commonsense policy that clarifies the authority of the Clean Water Act by creating a clear regulatory framework. If the Rule is repealed, at least fifty-two percent of Massachusetts' stream miles and millions of acres of wetlands nationwide will be at risk from pollution and development. Massachusetts is proud of its three federally designated Wild and Scenic Rivers, whose health would be threatened if their tributaries and neighboring wetlands become polluted. Seventy-three percent of Massachusetts residents rely on drinking water sources fed by small streams that are protected by the Clean Water Rule. Blocking this rule would imperil drinking water sources, as well as the communities and businesses that rely on clean water.<br/><br/>The economic benefits of the Clean Water Rule are extensive. The original 2015 EPA estimates for the Rule indicated that it would provide between $339 million and $572 million annually in benefits to the public. The documented economic benefits of wetland and stream protections include reducing flooding, filtering pollution, providing wildlife habitat, supporting hunting and fishing, and recharging groundwater. The elimination of all wetlands economic benefits from the new 2017 EPA cost-benefit analysis is illogical and misrepresents the value of these ecosystems. <br/><br/>In addition to providing key ecosystem services, small streams and wetlands also support crucial native species and are key to Massachusetts's vibrant recreational industry. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reports that in 2011, $2.0 billion was spent on wildlife recreation in MA, including $455 million on fishing alone. Healthy wetlands and headwater streams provide the clean, cool flows and essential habitat for our fish and wildlife populations. It is critical that we continue to protect these waterbodies with an inclusive definition of the Clean Water Rule. <br/><br/>States will be adversely affected by a repeal of the Clean Water Rule. By eliminating federal jurisdictions from wetlands and streams and allowing disparate state approaches, states downstream of more lax states will have reduced drinking water protection and flood control. Water does not begin and end at state lines and leaving this authority to the states will put us on a race to the bottom for water protection.<br/><br/>The Clean Water Act has a bold goal - to make all of our waterbodies fishable and swimmable. Repealing the Clean Water Rule will make it far more difficult to achieve this goal. Please listen to the majority of Americans who expect the EPA to protect clean water, not polluter profits. To repeal the Clean Water Rule now would be shortsighted and fly in the face of public opinion. We ask that the EPA keep the existing Rule and we ask the Army Corps to support this policy, to ensure robust protection of the country's water resources. <br/><br/>Thank you for considering our concerns.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Julia Blatt, Executive Director<br/>Massachusetts Rivers Alliance<br/>14 Beacon Street, Suite 607<br/>Boston, MA 02108

The federal government will have no management oversight or enforcement authority if traded. It will lack the ability to ensure the road is used for its intended purposes and avoid unauthorized incursions from the road into the refuge.  <br/><br/>I oppose the proposed land exchange and urge you to reject further consideration of a land exchange and road.

INFO - Title: Comment from Pelka, Ursula
INFO - Comment: Thank you for this opportunity to provide input regarding possible future regulations to better protect the animals covered under the Animal Welfare Act. I have concerns about several of the issues covered by this ANPR.<br/><br/>• Public handling of wild and exotic animals at licensed exhibitors should be banned. There should be no full-contact activities, no protected contact activities, no performances, no elephant rides, no feeding of animals, and no "swim-with" programs.<br/><br/>• The elimination of all public handling makes it unnecessary to categorize animals according to the risk they present to humans. Such a classification system is also based on a faulty premise. It fails to take into consideration the danger that humans pose to animals by, for example, causing stress or exposing them to disease. The only way to minimize risk of harm to the animals and promote their welfare is to prohibit public contact entirely.<br/><br/>• History has shown that performance standards do not work, so the USDA should establish specific, visible, and measurable standards for environmental enrichment. Such standards should be science-based and species-specific, and each animal should have sufficient space to perform normal behaviors and take advantage of environmental enrichment. There should be ongoing evaluation to ensure that enrichment plans are achieving their ends and that adjustments are made as needed.<br/><br/>• African and Asian elephants should not be kept on display in zoos in the United States. The best available science strongly indicates that keeping elephants in captive environments severely compromises their welfare. Zoo facilities cannot meet the species' complex biological, social, and cognitive requirements by adequately emulating wild habitats, diets, and social herd dynamics. There is no meaningful conservation benefit derived from relegating elephants to a lifetime in a captive environment that compromises their welfare.<br/><br/>• Before proceeding with any rule changes based on the ANPR, the USDA should issue the long-overdue update to its marine mammal regulations, which were withdrawn in 2017 with no further action since.<br/><br/>Until the USDA puts improved standards in place, it must do a better job of protecting animals with the existing regulations. Please cease allowing licensees who are habitually out of compliance from continuing in business and confiscate animals who are suffering as a result of abusive treatment.<br/><br/>Thank you.

Applying to nearly all insurance plans, many Americans will be forced purchase insurance that violates their consciences.  <br/><br/>The mandate is contrary to the assurance of Sen. Mikulski, author of the preventive services provision, that abortion would not be mandated “in any way.” A selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM), ella, like the FDA-approved abortion drug RU-486, can kill a human embryo after implantation.  Thus, by including ella, HRSA exceeded or abused the discretion it was granted under the ACA in determining what constitutes “preventive services.<br/><br/>Very truly yours, Susan Cuevas and family<br/><br/>

I am opposed to the Agency's flawed policy that a bachelor's degree in nursing is equivalent to a bachelor's degree in the biological sciences, as well as its proposal to list nursing "as a separate qualifying degree...for purposes of meeting the educational requirements for moderate and high complexity testing personnel and technical consultants."<br/><br/>A bachelor's degree in nursing is NOT equivalent to a biological sciences degree, and it does not provide academic instruction sufficient to perform or supervise non-waived laboratory testing. A biological sciences degree may require 60 semester hours or more of biological and chemical sciences-much of it upper level-whereas a nursing degree typically requires fewer than 15 semester hours of biological and or chemical science-most of which tends to be introductory/survey level. As a degree, it is insufficient to provide the necessary scientific knowledge and training in non-waived laboratory procedures. <br/><br/>Unless a bachelor's degree is substantially equivalent in terms of its course load and level and related laboratory training/experience, it should not allow its holder to perform high complexity testing or supervise non-waived laboratory testing. While I am aware of workforce shortages in the laboratory, these should not be solved by employing individuals from another health care discipline that has its own shortage situation. Patient safety demands quality laboratory testing performed by qualified individuals.<br/><br/>I urge you to "Put Patients First" by not allowing the nursing degree to satisfy CLIA's high complexity educational requirements.<br/><br/>Sincerely,

The people’s representatives in Congress NEVER gave authority to the executive branch (through OSHA) to require vaccines for employment at a private company. <br/><br/>This rule should absolutely be struck down by our courts in its entirety, and many state attorney generals are already filing suits to start this process.<br/><br/>I hope to see justice prevail.

INFO - Comment: Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Revised Designation of Critical Habitat for Canada lynxes in the Western United States. I appreciate the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's efforts to dedicate habitat for members of this iconic species and your consideration of the climate crisis and human infrastructure impacts on Canada lynx survival. While your plan is a positive step, I believe it could be improved with the following recommendations:<br/><br/>Carefully Consider Exclusions: The Service should evaluate whether the existing Habitat Conservation Plans in Unit 3 (Montana DNRC Multi-Species Habitat Conservation Plan) and Unit 4 (Washington DNR Lynx Habitat Management Plan) offer stronger protections for lynx habitat. Exclusions should only be permitted if these plans demonstrate stronger conservation measures. Otherwise, the Service should prioritize retaining areas under the Critical Habitat designation to ensure lynxes receive the highest level of protection.<br/><br/>Incorporate Tier 3 Areas for Connectivity: Connectivity is essential for the survival and dispersal of lynxes, and Tier 3 areas, while smaller, can facilitate this connectivity across the landscape. These areas should be included, especially in Units 6 and 7, where habitat is fragmented and isolated from the core lynx range. Expanding connectivity could help reestablish historical dispersal patterns, such as those observed with lynxes occasionally reaching the Southern Rockies from Canada during population booms.<br/><br/>Expand Unit 5 Beyond the 2014 Designation: The proposed reductions in Unit 5’s Critical Habitat are deeply concerning and may fail to meet the Service’s obligation to designate adequate habitat for species recovery. Instead of reductions, Unit 5 should be expanded to at least match — if not exceed — the 2014 designation. Given the increasing threats posed by the climate crisis, a larger protected habitat is critical for the long-term survival of lynxes as individuals and as a species.<br/><br/>Support Snowshoe Hare Conservation: Since lynx survival is closely tied to the availability of snowshoe hares, the Service should incorporate measures to conserve hare populations in areas where they are low. Ensuring abundant prey availability is fundamental to successful lynx recovery.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering these suggestions to strengthen the Critical Habitat Designation for the Canada lynx. These enhancements will ensure that the plan provides the strongest protections possible for this species in the face of the climate crisis and other threats.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Sara Pennini

INFO - Comment: On the previous proposal I had commented that the proposed brace rules were subjective and based solely on the opinion of the ATF not founded in the rule of law, or any regulation found in the US code. Apparently someone at the ATF does not understand that objective rules are not subjective rules with numbers. Objective rules are not ones that attempt to divine the intent of the manufacturer or a particular firearm by subjectively deciding what is and isn't useful in the use of a pistol brace. The intent of this document is clear: The ATF wishes to ban pistol braced firearms without actually saying the words, because the ATF and all of us know that the ATF lacks the authority to say those words.<br/><br/>At issue here is still a limitless degree of subjectivity as noted in phrases like:<br/>"Minimized Rear Surface lacking features to discourage shouldering."<br/><br/>What is the correct surface area to be 'minimized'? Which features would discourage shouldering? EG would attaching legos to the end of a Shockwave blade make it discourage shouldering? Or would that increase the rear surface area to encourage shouldering? You can see how this level of subjectivity could lead to many mis-interpretations of ATF regulations and create overnight felons.<br/><br/>How is the adjustability of a brace objective criteria for determining its intention to not be a pistol brace? Am I to understand the ATF believes all humans have the same proportions? What objective basis does the ATF have to support this?<br/><br/>The ATF seems to be obsessed with examples of how this applies to the AR-15 platform pistols but has no consideration in its rules to accommodate any other design or type of firearm, such as AK-platform braces, MP5 platform braces, or M1913 rail attached braces. How am I to believe that these are encompassing and objective rules when they cannot be applied to all types of firearms?<br/><br/>The removal of the strap is also a troubling addition to these arbitrary and capricious rules. Am I to understand if I take a firearm with a 'score' of 3, and simply remove the brace strap for cleaning and maintenance I have created a short barreled rifle? Will the ATF enforce this rule?<br/><br/>How can the ATF justify that any particular type of sight is objectively better or worse for use as a pistol? for example, iron sights are considered a penalty, but the iron sights on many pistol braced firearms are actually quite serviceable as pistol sights, such as the Stribog SP9 which has pistol-type three post pistol sights, or the AK-47 type pistols which have the notch and post which is virtually identical to most modern handguns in terms of form and function. Are these Iron sights indications of intent to use the pistol as a rifle? Objectively, how short of an eye relief does the ATF believe a sight must have to be 'incompatible with single handed fire?' is 3 inches enough? 4? 5? 16? 100? The ATF seems silent on this issue in its proposed rules. Am I  to understand that the presence of the standard iron sights on a glock handgun would give it a point against it to becoming a pistol braced firearm if I were to attach a brace to the handgun?<br/><br/>These are just a few of the examples of how the ATF's confounding, capricious, and arbitrary rules will simply create more confusion about the legality of pistol braced firearms than will be solved by simply maintaining the status quo of acknowledging that placing a pistol brace on a firearm indicates that the user intends it to be used as a pistol not as a rifle.

With this interim final rule, Commerce acknowledged the risks posed by its current lax firearms export controls. This rule includes much needed reforms to prevent American firearms from landing in the hands of terrorists, drug cartels, gun traffickers, rogue regimes, and others who pose a threat to human rights, democracy, and U.S. national security. <br/><br/>We have a critical role to play in ending gun violence both at home and abroad, and this rule positions the Department of Commerce to be part of the solution. We must stop prioritizing gun industry profits over human lives and public safety. This rule will help do that by reducing the risk of legally exported firearms and related items being diverted or misused in ways that make the world less safe and secure.<br/><br/>This rule could be further strengthened by adding a presumption of denial to applications for assault weapon exports to non-governmental actors worldwide, including more details about the process and methodology for evaluating risk factors, and adding requirements for increased transparency and data sharing. But I applaud Commerce for taking these first critical steps in reducing international gun violence and other abuses fueled by the U.S. gun industry.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Travis Collins<br/>TX 76017

Guns sold without background checks—both online and at gun shows—are a huge source for gun traffickers and people looking to avoid a background check. These guns often end up trafficked across state lines, recovered at crime scenes in major cities, and used against police officers. This contributes to the gun violence epidemic plaguing our country. The long-standing lack of clarity around which sellers must become licensed and run background checks has made this problem all the worse. <br/><br/>I support the clear common-sense standard laid out in this rule: Anyone offering guns for sale online or at a gun show is presumed to be trying to make a profit and should therefore be licensed and run a background check on their customers.

This imbalance is grossly incompatible with current U.S. climate and conservation goals. The prioritization of resource extraction is actively contributing to the climate crisis; use of lands for unregulated motorized recreation is destroying critical wildlife habitat and damaging important Indigenous cultural sites. <br/><br/>The agency must rebalance its management of public lands. By shifting the agency’s focus to prioritize conservation, BLM can take bold action to protect imperiled wildlife, preserve vanishing cultural sites and protect vital natural resources like carbon sinks and water supplies in the era of climate change. In fact, recent polling found that 82 percent of voters in the West support the goal of conserving 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030, and four-in-five say loss of open natural areas is a problem. <br/><br/>During the White House Conservation in Action Summit, President Biden reflected that our conservation work is critical for providing a bridge to our past and future. Failure to prioritize conservation of the lands you manage now will surely burn that bridge for generations to come.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Judy Kushner<br/>Cherry Hill, NJ 08034<br/>heyjude12850@aol.com

INFO - Title: Comment from Rhoades, Sandra
INFO - Comment: I urge the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries to rescind in full the 2019 Trump-era regulations that severely weakened protections for our nation_s most imperiled animals and plants. These changes represented the most significant rollbacks to the Endangered Species Act in the law_s 50-year history and pushed hundreds of species closer to the brink of extinction.  <br/> <br/>It is extremely disappointing that this proposed rule retains a number of harmful provisions governing the responsibility of federal agencies to avoid jeopardizing protected species or adversely modifying their critical habitat. In particular, it retains a definition of _adverse modification_ that requires federal actions to affect species_ critical habitat _as a whole_ before real habitat protections are put in place. This is especially harmful for species like the northern spotted owl, polar bear or gulf sturgeon that have large critical habitat designations but are still at risk of extinction. The provision ignores the basic fact that the single largest driver of extinction here and around the world is habitat loss and allows the Services to turn a blind eye to the vast majority of actions that harm critical habitat.  <br/> <br/>The proposed rule also retains the Trump-era definition of _environmental baseline,_ which lets federal agencies off the hook for past harms to endangered species from things like dam or highway construction by deeming these projects part of the baseline. It absolves the agencies of much responsibility for the damage caused by interrelated actions they facilitate, such as urban growth from highway expansion or increased global warming from emissions related to federal oil and gas leasing.  <br/> <br/>The remaining Trump-era regulations that the agencies are proposing to retain _ including the criteria for not prudent determinations for critical habitat _ are equally problematic and will continue to put endangered species at greater risk of extinction. Thus, I urge the Services to rescind them in their entirety without exception. <br/> <br/>There are some aspects of the proposed rule that I support. I am grateful that the Biden administration plans to restore the _blanket 4(d) rule,_ which will restore protections for threatened species. I also support again prohibiting consideration of economic impacts when deciding to protect species.  <br/><br/>However, while the proposed rule restores some pieces of the Endangered Species Act regulations, it is wholly inadequate and represents a huge missed opportunity to make meaningful progress to recover our most vulnerable animals and plants on the 50th anniversary of the Act_s passage.  <br/> <br/>With time running out, we can_t afford more of the status quo. Combating the global wildlife extinction crisis will require the Services to be bolder and more visionary than any other administration in history. For these reasons, I urge the Services to not only rescind the Trump-era rollbacks in their entirety, but to also strengthen the implementation of the Endangered Species Act to avert the extinction crisis and curtail the ongoing loss of biodiversity in the United States and around the world.

This not only constitutes inappropriate government interference with private labor relations; it amounts to an unfair government preference that can significantly impact the cost of public works. <br/><br/>The use of government-mandated PLAs hurts both union and open-shop contractors. Typically, government-mandated PLAs will include union security clauses that require all craft workers to pay either union dues or an equivalent amount of union agency fees, whether or not the workers have any interest in union representation.  This may deter workers from applying for, or accepting an assignment on, a PLA project, exacerbating already-challenging labor supply conditions. <br/><br/>In addition, PLAs can give rise to jurisdictional disputes that would not otherwise occur. For these reasons, among others, government-mandated PLAs would likely exacerbate workforce challenges, not improve them. This will act as a barrier for the hiring of small businesses, including minority- and woman-owned businesses, and the fulfillment of small-business utilization goals. Such businesses are largely open-shop and are among those least able to make the above-described changes that a PLA requires.  <br/><br/>The government fails to show how mandating PLAs will benefit federal construction projects. Government mandates for PLAseven when competition, on its face, is open to all contractorscan have the effect of limiting the number of competitors on a project, increasing costs to the government and, ultimately, the taxpayers.  For example, the Associated General Contractors of America recently conducted a survey of which 73% of federal contractors responded that they are not interested in bidding if there is a government-mandated PLA on a federal construction project, compared to 27% that responded they are still interested in bidding. <br/><br/>For these reasons, I strongly urge the FAR Council to withdraw the proposed rule, FAR Case 2022-003, and not to issue government-mandated PLAs on federal construction projects.

INFO - Comment: I can't believe citizens are having to make this argument: VACCINES BECOME MORE EFFECT WHEN SCALED UP AND ARE LESS EFFECTIVE AT SMALLER SCALE. Given all the taxpayer money that has already gone into developing Covid vaccines, I'm astonished that we would abandon that investment in public health. Vaccines should be free to all, regardless of age. Any other policy is both cruel and unforgivably stupid. No one who purports to work for public health should countenance restrictions on vaccine access.

The Flores decision sets clear guidelines that direct the government to reunite children with a parent or relative without delay and provides standards and protections for children while in government custody.  The proposed rule seeks to weaken or remove those protections and allow children to be jailed indefinitely.<br/><br/>Among many other concerning changes, this rule would:<br/>- Give the administration the power to self-license and implement standards at detention centers at a time when reports that show that DHS is not capable of maintaining clean, humane and safe detention centers currently.<br/>- Weaken protections for children as they undergo processing in detention facilities and make release from detention and reunification with family members a more difficult process.  DHS would have increased authority to change the rules regarding when and how children can be reunified and with whom. DHS and HHS are also given the authority to declare an emergency and completely suspend protections for children.<br/>- Reverses a child’s right to a bond hearing and instead creates an agency-run administrative process that poses threats to due process<br/><br/>This rule outlines a system where an avowedly anti-immigrant administration, responsible for separating over 2,000 children from their parents, is able to create and change the rules of immigrant enforcement, due process, and the already deplorable detention conditions for children as they see fit.  These changes are unconscionable, inhumane and would directly harm children and families who have come to the United States to seek a better life.<br/><br/>I am morally opposed to jailing children and families and believe that our government should focus on keeping families together, alternatives to detention and full due process under the law.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms. Otilia Burnett<br/>4114 Shelley Ave 4114 Shelley Ave. Colorado Springs, CO 80910-2530<br/>otiliaburnett96@gmail.com<br/>

INFO - Comment: <br/>As a physician anesthesiologist, I believe all patients, especially Medicare patients, deserve high-quality care. This is why I strongly urge the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure that the requirement of physician involvement in the anesthesia care of Medicare patients is reinstated.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE), CMS issued a temporary waiver of the Medicare requirement of physician anesthesiologists in anesthesia care to prepare for potential shortages of physician providers.  Unfortunately, this was done without substantial justification; the pandemic does not necessitate this policy change because the existing supervision rule already provides for flexibility, deferring to state Governors to opt-out of the requirement if necessary. There have been no demonstrated shortages of anesthesia providers, and states have rescinded early waivers noting that the elimination of physician involvement related to anesthesia care serves no purpose. Further, replacing physician anesthesiologist-led care does not create any cost savings nurse anesthetists and physician anesthesiologists bill Medicare the same amount.<br/><br/>As the public health emergency continues, physicians and all providers on the front lines know that the Medicare waiver is unnecessary.  We have seen that COVID-19 has reinforced the need for team-based anesthesia and critical care services as their expertise and training is critical to the care of COVID-positive patients.  Covid-19 can cause serious lung and breathing problems in patients of all ages; one of the key roles of an anesthesiologist during surgery is to maintain a patient's breathing.  Older patients infected with COVID-19 are some of the most complex and challenging cases a physician will see in their career.  Now is not the time to take the physician away from patients.<br/><br/>Any attempt to permanently remove physician involvement in anesthesia care is dangerous and lowers the standard of care. Many Medicare patients have conditions that put them at higher risk during surgery. While the nurse-only model of care may be appropriate for other health care settings such as primary care, it is not a safe approach for Medicare beneficiaries in the acute, critical, and perioperative care settings, where life-threatening situations occur unpredictably. It is these instances where a physician's significant training and education is required for accurate diagnosis and successful intervention. When seconds count, you want a medical doctor leading a patient's care, not a nurse.<br/><br/>Medicare patients deserve to have access to the highest quality, team-based model of anesthesia care to ensure their safety. I urge you preserve the current Medicare anesthesia safety standard.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>Dr. Venkat R. Mangunta Missouri

Doing so defends the worst actors of the oil and gas industry, and puts their interests above the health and safety of American families and their communities, all while wasting taxpayer dollars. According to BLMs own analysis, weakening the Rule will allow $824 million worth of publicly-owned natural gas to be wasted over the next decade.   States like Colorado and the best companies in the business have made it clear that this problem can be fixed using available, low-cost technologies. And the majority of Americans want to see strong protections implemented.   Without public hearings, their voices aren't being heard. Please establish public hearings across the West so that the Americans affected by this proposal can give their input.   And instead of moving forward with this dangerous new proposal, please leave in place the current limits that effectively protect Americans' health, safety, and wallets.

INFO - Comment: I am writing to oppose your proposal to rescind the regulatory definition of “harm” under the Endangered Species Act. <br/><br/>Habitat destruction is the main driver of species decline. When Congress passed the Endangered Species Act, it explicitly recognized the importance of habitat in protecting and restoring endangered species. And the definition of harm you seek to delete was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court 30 years ago. If anything, the case for habitat protection under the ESA has grown even stronger since then, with mountains of scientific evidence linking habitat and species’ survival.   <br/><br/>There is no rational reason to rescind this definition; rescission only serves as an invitation to timber, oil, mining and other extractive industries, as well as the government and individuals, to try to destroy habitat that endangered species need to live, eat, and raise their young. Common sense, science, and the ESA itself tells us that habitat destruction harms species.  <br/><br/>Just one company or project can destroy habitat, but when a species disappears, we all suffer the consequences, which can include impacts to our food and water supply, to industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to tourism, and to our cultural and spiritual values.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>John Ouellette<br/>Manchester, NH

We should all be working to build a society that stands with moms in need. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act was a major, bipartisan achievement toward that goal—an achievement made possible because Congress had the good sense to leave abortion out of it (as confirmed by senators who spoke on it at the time).<br/><br/>It is unconscionable that the EEOC is trying to corrupt this landmark law by interpreting it to require employers to grant accommodations for abortion, the complete opposite of supporting pregnancy, and not what Congress intended. I strongly urge the EEOC not to include abortion in its final regulations, and to enact a religious exemption that is more clear and robust than what is proposed and ensures that employers are not required to act contrary to their religious beliefs.<br/><br/>Democrats and Republicans were able to come together and do a good thing for pregnant women and their babies by passing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The EEOC should not sabotage their work by turning the law into an abortion-accommodating mandate.

For nearly four decades, NEPA’s burdensome and overbearing regulations have held back American infrastructure and hurt union workers. <br/><br/>It’s time for that to change. We must take advantage of the opportunity we have to modernize NEPA. Reforming NEPA would unleash American investment, create good-paying, union jobs across the country, and give a boost to our economy. <br/><br/>Right now, the United States ranks near the bottom in permitting among industrialized countries — 26 out of 33 — according to the World Bank’s most recent ‘Doing Business’ study. <br/><br/>The proposed reform from the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) would be a huge win for union workers. It will reduce delays and uncertainties and lower the overall risk for companies — resulting in more roads, bridges, and airports being built and more union jobs. <br/><br/>Modernizing NEPA would be a huge win for union workers and we must act now.  I strongly support the Council on Environmental Quality’s proposed reforms.<br/><br/>Regards, <br/>Alex Gallaga<br/>Sheridan road<br/>Beach park, IL, 60087 <br/>

INFO - Comment: As a clinician, I urge CMS to ensure the final Physician Fee Schedule for 2023 strengthens access to psychological services and gives behavioral health professionals the tools they need to meet the mental health needs of diverse communities. Many of the issues raised in this year's Physician Fee Schedule have serious implications for equity in access to behavioral health care. Through my comments, I urge CMS to adopt policies with the overall goal of facilitating access to mental and behavioral health treatment in underserved communities to the maximum extent possible. <br/><br/>Strengthen the Practice of Psychology<br/> BHI Codes <br/>I support CMS' proposed coding and payment for General Behavioral Health Integration (BHI) to recognize psychologists' role in integrated care. I appreciate CMS' support for multiple evidence-based models of integrated care, as it allows psychologists the flexibility required to support the behavioral health needs of the broader community.<br/> Medicare Potentially Underutilized Services<br/>I appreciate CMS' request for comments on potentially underutilized services, as several of the services CMS identified are performed by psychologists. I recommend CMS create additional Cognitive Assessment & Care codes without the medication reconciliation service because medication management is outside the scope of a psychologist's license in many states. Additionally, I recommend CMS allow reimbursement for Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Obesity services provided by psychologists. <br/> Chronic Pain Management and Treatment (CPM) Bundles<br/>I ask CMS to create additional bundled pain management codes that do not include medication management. I am concerned that psychologists would be excluded from this new bundled service because in most states medication management is outside the scope of a psychologist's license. Psychologists play a critical role in implementing non-pharmacological approaches to treatment, which may be safer or more effective for some patients, as well as team-based comprehensive pain management.<br/> Telehealth<br/>Many patients in rural and underserved areas are now able to access mental health services, often for the first time. Additionally, many patients prefer utilizing telehealth for a variety of reasons. Reverting to the non-facility rate for telehealth services after the end of the COVID public health emergency will lead practitioners to offer telehealth less frequently or to restrict the number of Medicare beneficiaries they treat using telehealth.<br/><br/>Expand Psychology Training and Workforce Development<br/> Supervision by Psychologists <br/>I applaud CMS' Proposed Revisions to the "Incident to" Physicians' Services Regulation for Behavioral Health Services to allow for reimbursement for Physicians and Non-Physician Providers (NPPs), which include psychologists, who supervise these practitioners in their everyday practice. This will help expand access to and coordination of mental health services in rural and underserved areas where masters'-level practitioners represent a substantial segment of the mental health providers in the area.<br/> Advanced Psychology Trainee Services <br/>I urge CMS to allow for Medicare reimbursement of services provided by advanced psychology trainees under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. Although psychology interns receive extensive clinical experience prior to their internship, services provided by trainees under the supervision of a licensed psychologist are not reimbursable under Medicare. Without Medicare reimbursement of services provided by trainees, training programs lack a steady source of funding. <br/><br/>Support the Psychological Research-to-Practice Pipeline<br/> Caregiving Behavior Management Training<br/>I ask CMS to reconsider its position on the caregiver behavior management training codes. There is extensive empirical support for caregiver behavior management training and it is the gold standard treatment approach for several health behavior issues. Although the patient is not present when this training is provided, these codes have many benefits for the patient, including a reduction in disruptive and problematic behaviors for children with ADHD, improved weight management for individuals with obesity, and better management of patients with dementia.<br/> Digital Therapeutics<br/>I urge CMS to accept APA's proposal that would establish a new set of reimbursement codes for digital therapeutics-one for purchase of the device, one for patient education about the device, and two for ongoing management of the service furnished through the device.  Unlike the RTM codes, this structure reimburses for an active therapeutic intervention, as opposed to passively monitoring a patient's condition. A new set of reimbursement codes as outlined above will have a positive impact on access to treatment amongst patients who have limited access to traditional office-based treatment or who prefer the use of digital devices over a face-to-face visit.

This proposal has the clear potential to help remedy longstanding disparities in access to these services. <br/><br/>Facilitating Access to the Complete Spectrum of Behavioral Health Services<br/>I applaud CMS proposal to increase the work values for the psychotherapy codes, but I implore CMS to also increase these values for the psychological and neuropsychological testing services, as well as the Health Behavior Assessment & Intervention services. These services are systematically undervalued and warrant increases.  The reimbursement discrepancy will negatively impact patient access to these critical services.<br/><br/>Utilizing Community Health Workers and Assessing Social Determinants of Health<br/>While I appreciate CMS proposals for services addressing health-related social needs, the current proposals for Community Health Integration (CHI) services and Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Risk Assessment both fall short by requiring an Evaluation/Management service furnished by a medical professional.  I urge CMS to revise these proposals to be inclusive of a psychiatric diagnostic evaluation or a health behavioral assessment furnished by a psychologist to serve as the initiating service.<br/><br/>Maintaining Progress in Telehealth Access<br/>Telehealth is a critical vehicle for achieving health equity for patients in communities that have long struggled to access behavioral health treatment. I appreciate CMS recognition that reverting to a lower rate for telehealth services to patients in their homes will lead practitioners to offer telehealth less frequently and I support the proposed rule preserving current reimbursement rates for telehealth services.<br/><br/>Ensuring Access to Science-Based Behavior Management<br/>I support the proposals to activate reimbursement for caregiver behavior management training services. There is extensive empirical support for caregiver behavior management training, and it is the gold standard treatment approach for several health behavior issues. <br/><br/>Facilitating a Population Health Approach to Crisis Treatment<br/>I also support the proposal to create new codes for psychotherapy crisis services furnished outside a traditional setting. A population health approach treats the health of communities and often demands provision of services in non-traditional settings. Those in a crisis should feel free to access services wherever they are in need, and I commend CMS for enabling this flexibility through the proposed rule. <br/><br/>Ensuring Robust Access to Substance Use Disorder Treatment<br/>I support the increased reimbursement for psychotherapy services in the substance use services bundle. Despite some progress over the past several years, the substance use disorder crisis continues to devastate many communities, and this measure will help ensure continued access to common forms of substance use treatment.<br/><br/>Utilizing Technology to Improve Behavioral Health Access<br/>I thank CMS for including requests for information on digital cognitive behavioral therapy.  I recommend that CMS adopt APA Services proposal for a coding structure on evidence-based digital cognitive behavior therapy that recognizes the cost of the device, patient set-up and education, and management of the service furnished through the device as coequal components of successful treatment via these devices.<br/><br/>Accurately Measuring Costs of Providing Treatment<br/>I appreciate that CMS acknowledges practice expense (PE) methodology irregularities that negatively affect reimbursement for behavioral health services.  APA Services developed recommendations for adjustments to improve PE valuation.  l urge CMS to work with APA Services to implement these recommendations to improve PE valuation and reimbursement for behavioral health services.  <br/><br/>Encouraging New Approaches to Suicide Prevention<br/>I was encouraged by CMS request for comments on additional coding and payment for evidence-based interventions for patients at risk of suicide.  There is a need for additional codes, and I urge CMS to work with APA Services to develop new codes for brief interventions and safety planning for patients at risk of suicide.

It was very dangerous. Additional bridge closings will only make this worse, creating very hazardous boating conditions.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Purdue,<br/><br/>I am urging you to withdraw the proposed rule to 'modernize' swine slaughter inspection and issue a new proposal that prioritizes food safety.<br/><br/>The proposed rule puts consumers at risk of foodborne illness by removing important microbiological testing requirements for Salmonella and generic E coli that have been at the core of efforts to modernize food safety since the 1990s. In place of these requirements, slaughterhouses will be allowed to design their own individualized testing programs, making it impossible to compare performance or spot the worst performers industry-wide.<br/><br/>The rule also proposes a New Swine Inspection System that hands over important duties currently fulfilled by USDA?s Food Safety Inspection Service inspectors to slaughter establishment employees. The proposal also removes caps on line speeds, increasing the risk that carcasses will fly by too quickly for inspectors to detect animal disease, fecal contamination, and other food safety issues. <br/><br/>When the USDA implemented the New Poultry Inspection System in 2014, it maintained a maximum line speed and kept in place updated microbial performance standards. Even with these additional measures, contamination rates do not appear to have gone down.<br/><br/>The goal of modernizing inspections should be to make food safer, and this proposal will not achieve that. Instead, it has the potential to make food less safe by de-regulating swine inspection, handing important government duties to industry while removing microbial standards needed to verify that industry is performing those duties effectively.<br/><br/>We urge you to withdraw the proposed rule and design a new rule that prioritizes food safety through enhanced microbial testing and the implementation of pre-harvest pathogen reduction requirements that will significantly reduce contamination and foodborne illness.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Michael Lanham<br/>Hawley, PA

INFO - Comment: I strongly support increased broker transparency under 49 CFR §371.3 but urge the Agency to adopt stronger measures, including immediate disclosure of transaction records upon delivery acceptance. The current lack of transparency exploits motor carriers, inflates consumer costs, and compromises highway safety.<br/><br/>Transparency Protects Safety and Reduces Exploitation<br/>Opaque broker practices harm carriers, forcing them to cut costs to stay operational. This often leads to deferred truck maintenance, longer work hours, and driver fatigue—direct threats to highway safety. Additionally, brokers frequently take excessive margins by charging shippers far more than they pay carriers. For example, brokers charge shippers $50 per hour for detention time but compensate carriers only $35 per hour—and only after a four-hour delay. Such practices increase costs for consumers while unfairly exploiting truckers.<br/><br/>Immediate Transparency is Essential<br/>The proposed 48-hour delay in record disclosure allows brokers to manipulate and withhold critical information. Transparency should occur immediately upon delivery acceptance, empowering carriers to resolve disputes and negotiate fair rates. Other broker-based industries, such as real estate, disclose fees upfront; the freight industry must meet the same standard.<br/><br/>Shippers Must Pay Carriers Directly<br/>The current system, where brokers act as payment intermediaries, creates unnecessary complications. Brokers often subcontract loads to other brokers, further obscuring payments and eroding carrier earnings. Direct shipper-to-carrier payments would eliminate these issues, ensuring timely and fair compensation while reducing administrative inefficiencies. Legal precedent, including Exel, Inc. v. Southern Refrigerated Transport, Inc. (807 F.3d 140, 6th Cir. 2015), affirms that shippers are ultimately responsible for paying carriers, supporting this reform.<br/><br/>Ban Waivers of Transparency Rights<br/>Brokers routinely require carriers to waive their rights under §371.3, undermining transparency. These waivers should be explicitly prohibited, and brokers must comply with transparency requirements regardless of contract terms.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>The FMCSA must address these critical issues to ensure fairness, safety, and efficiency in brokered freight transactions. I recommend:<br/><br/>Immediate disclosure of transaction records upon delivery acceptance.<br/>Upfront fee transparency for broker margins.<br/>Prohibiting multi-broker subcontracting without disclosure.<br/>Direct payments from shippers to carriers.<br/>Explicitly banning waivers of §371.3 rights.<br/>These changes will protect carriers, reduce costs for consumers, and promote safety. Thank you for considering these urgent recommendations.

These revisions were the gravest assault on the Endangered Species Act in its five-decade history and threaten the future of already-imperiled species.<br/><br/>It is extremely disappointing that this Administration has had years to reverse these harmful changes to the Endangered Species Act and has–to date–chosen to leave many of the Trump Administration’s policies in place.

If the FDA moves forward with restricting compounded GLP-1s, patients will be faced with the difficult choice of either spending significantly more money on name-brand products or forgoing a treatment that has been life-changing. <br/><br/>Compounded GLP-1s are not just an alternative—they are essential medications for patients who rely on them to manage their health safely and effectively. Restricting access to compounded GLP-1s would undermine the health of patients who have no other viable options.<br/><br/>I ask you to consider the real, life-changing impact of these treatments.

Without them, millions of Americans will likely face increased costs at the pharmacy, and for many, this change could cause them to abandon critical treatments. <br/><br/>It is up to insurance companies to determine where the savings from cost-sharing assistance programs are applied, either passed along to the patients or kept by the health insurer. However, this rule would require manufacturers to guarantee all savings are passed to the patient. Since it would be impossible for manufacturers to make that guarantee, it is likely that they would be limited in their ability to continue providing cost-sharing assistance programs. <br/><br/>As a result, if this provision moves forward, it is plain to see that these vital programs are in critical danger. Ultimately, this rule could put in jeopardy the financial assistance millions of Americans rely upon to get the prescription medications they need. <br/><br/>For these reasons, I urge you to protect patient access to cost-sharing assistance by removing this provision from the final Medicaid rule. By doing so, you will help protect access to the medications Americans need to maintain their health.

The current five-year offshore leasing program does not allow for new lease sales in the Beaufort Sea. Preparing for a new lease sale at this point is premature and indicates that BOEM has pre-determined the outcome of planning process it is currently undertaking for 2019?2024?even though a new program is still in its initial stages.<br/> <br/>There is no compelling reason to rush to sell leases in the Beaufort Sea. In recent years, oil companies have walked away from investments there. Moreover, drilling in these waters could cause enormous damage. A major oil spill could have severe consequences and would be all but impossible to clean up. Even routine oil and gas operations create noise, air and water pollution, and they generate air and vessel traffic that can have serious consequences.<br/> <br/>If BOEM continues to consider a 2019 Beaufort Sea lease sale, it should exclude offshore areas with particularly important biological or cultural importance. These areas include the Barrow Canyon area, the region between Oliktok Point and Demarcation Bay, Smith Bay, the Harrison Bay?Colville Delta region, and the Beaufort shelf break. In addition, BOEM should heed requests to exclude areas that are important for subsistence hunting.<br/> <br/>Sincerely,

As noted in the proposed rule, steps like these to protect churches and other faith-based employers, ensuring they have a level playing field with others, are nothing new. The Civil Rights Act was signed into law by President Johnson in 1964 and, in Title VII, regarding employment, Congress provided important protections for religious employers. Congress even broadened these protections about a decade later.<br/><br/>President Johnson understood the need to ensure that faith-based employers had a level playing field of access to and competition for grants and took this into account in Executive Order (EO) 11246 on federal contracting.<br/><br/>When the DOL was tasked with enforcing EO 11246 in 1978 it included Title VIIs exemption for religious educational institutions in its implementing regulations. In 2002 President Bush amended the EO by including Title VIIs exemption for religious organizations, which has since also been implemented by DOLs regulations.<br/><br/>It wasnt until the Obama administration that protections for faith-based employers were curtailed. The Trump administration DOL is reinvigorating these protections to their former status in line with, not only historical precedent, but recent decisions from the Supreme Court. For example, inTrinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, a church that ran a daycare center was denied access to a government grant program for nonprofit organizations to make their playgrounds safer for children, simply because they were a church. The Supreme Court made clear that Trinity Lutheran Church had just as much right to participate in the grant program as any other daycare center; their status as a church did not prevent them from playing an equal role in the public square. With this rule, the Trump administration DOL is simply affirming a principle the Supreme Court held to be squarely in line with the First Amendment by a 7-2 vote.<br/><br/>Religious liberty is a vital cornerstone of our nation. It is imperative that it is closely guarded and upheld. I commend the DOL for doing just that with this rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mrs. Sheilah Marshall

INFO - Title: Comment from PRICE, GARY
INFO - Comment: I am an independent financial advisor. My small business provides financial planning and other services to numerous clients. As a member of the Financial Services Institute, I am writing to express my concern with the Department of Labor's (DOL) recently proposed Independent Contractor Rule (Proposed Rule), which would eliminate the DOL's 2021 Rule on the subject. Contrary to the DOL's claims, eliminating the 2021 Rule will restore the previous state of confusion and uncertainty surrounding worker classification and harm my business. I encourage the DOL to modify its proposal to ensure that legitimate independent contractors, like myself, are protected from misclassification as employees. <br/><br/>As an independent financial advisor, I help Main Street Americans plan for a secure financial future. I am a licensed professional who chose to operate my own business including building client relationships and developing a valuable professional reputation. This was not a decision I undertook lightly, nor one forced upon me, but I chose to be an independent contractor to build my own business and better serve my clients without input from a corporate parent. Simply put, as an independent financial advisor I am free to recommend the financial products and services that I believe are truly in my clients' best interests while building equity in my business. <br/><br/>While I am a self-employed independent contractor, I am affiliated with an Independent financial services firm. Because the financial services industry is heavily regulated in order to protect investors, the firm with which I am affiliated is required by state and federal law to supervise my activities to comply with regulatory requirements. This legally required supervisory structure should not be misconstrued as an employee-employer relationship. The 2021 Rule specified that requiring an individual to comply with legal or contractual obligations does not constitute control. Unfortunately, the Proposed Rule would not just eliminate this important clarification critical to our industry but would make it "indicative of control" and, thus, an employee-employer relationship. <br/><br/>Uncertainty surrounding my status as a legitimate independent contractor hurts my business. It decreases the value of the business that I have built (an investment of time and money, including hiring my own employees) and takes resources away from the core work of helping clients with financial planning to defend against inaccurate claims of misclassification. The 2021 Rule provided the framework for a consistent application of the economic realities test focusing on two "core factors." This offered the tens of thousands of financial advisors like me regulatory clarity that is critically important for us to operate our businesses and focus on serving our clients. The Proposed Rule would revert to an unweighted six factor totality of the circumstances test, which significantly complicates the analysis and allows for inconsistent application (as was frequently the case before the 2021 Rule became effective). On top of that, the proposal significantly alters how those six factors are defined and applied, tilting them against independent contractor status in numerous ways.  <br/><br/>While I understand the desire to curtail or prevent abuses of worker classification laws, the relationship between independent broker-dealer firms and their affiliated financial advisors is different from other professions. I urge the DOL to keep the 2021 Rule in place in order to protect legitimate independent contractors, like myself, from misclassification as employees or, alternatively substantially modify this proposal so as avoid damaging my business and harming the clients I serve.

There is no shortage of physician anesthesiologists in VA, and the current system allows for sufficient flexibility to address the needs of all VA hospitals. VA should follow through for Veterans by including in the Final Rule what it has publicly expressed: the current team-based model of anesthesia care is serving Veterans safely and effectively. VA's own patient safety research found there is reason to doubt the safety of anesthesia without physician involvement.

INFO - Comment: I'm writing to oppose the DHS proposed ruling that changes student visas from duration of status to fixed end dates. For graduate students, program durations are uncertain with the average time to degree being 6 years. With a visa duration of 4 years under the proposed ruling, many students would be unable to complete their degree with extensions, which DHS sets a very high bar for in this proposed ruling. Worse, students from some countries have this duration even further reduced to 2 years based on where they were born. This proposed rule would unnecessarily place a burden on international students and threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs supported by them. This disruption will threaten university communities and have a chilling effect on international students willingness to study in the US moving forward.<br/>

This is caused by the inablility of drivers to work at current levels.  As a over the road driver I am very acclamated to driving 11 hours.

Typically I am way from home for 5 weeks at a time.  34 hours of off duty break time is more than enough.  Requiring two overnight rest periods and only allowing a restart once every 168 hours doesn't even make sense.  Changing this just means that over the road drivers will sit  waiting to drive VS. being able to get moving.  You can only sleep so much and there is nothing else to do when you are away from home.  You are actually more tired after sitting for extended times.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Continuing to change the hours of service makes us more vulnerable to log book violations because of the increasing complexity.

INFO - Title: Amsurg North Valley Endoscopy Center, McKellar, Lorie--AZ
INFO - Comment: I strongly support quality reporting that is meaningful, supports performance improvement, harmonizes measures across ambulatory surgical settings, and is not burdensome to ASC staff. I do not support the adoption of any of the measures proposed for inclusion in the ASCQR program for 2016. We currently collect information on patient complications through post op phone calls and surveillance. However, the suggested specifications would not be information that the center has in the ASC medical record, and it would have to be obtained from the physician’s office. By virtue of the requirement for ASC’s to function as distinct entities (42 CFR 416.2), the centers do not provide postoperative care following discharge from the ASC. All measures are currently included in the Physician Quality Reporting System.  ASC reporting of the same measures would be duplicate effort which would not yield further benefit. The proposed visual function measure relies on the administration of two Visual Functioning VF-8R patient questionnaires (per the PQRS measure).  The timing and logistics of these surveys are more appropriately coordinated by the physician office. The measures do not currently hold endorsement by the National Quality Form for the ASC setting.   It is important to note the difference between an ambulatory clinic and an ambulatory surgical center.  The ASC does not provide ongoing care to the patient but serves as the site for the actual procedure or surgery.  ASC care does not include the postoperative follow up, which is conducted at the physician office or other type of clinic. Similarly, ASC’s performing colonoscopies would only have data related to procedures performed at that specific center.  Otherwise, information would have to be obtained from other providers.The determination of the follow up period for colonoscopy is not ultimately made by the ASC.  While the ASC staff supports patient education and follow up, the patient receives those recommendations from the physician.The extra work required to gather the information will be burdensome to the ASC’s.  In the absence of an EMR, additional center staff will need to be hired to perform manual chart abstraction and measure tracking. Performance improvement activities are meaningful if applied to outcomes or processes over which the facility has control.  The proposed measures do not meet this criteria.  CMS should seek to identify measures that evaluate relevant aspects of the care of the patient while at the ASC. Our center has been using a CAHPS modeled survey for 3 years, and we welcome the application of that measure for the ASC’s.

INFO - Comment: I support the BLMs proposed oil and gas rules. These common-sense reforms are long overdue. Americas federal oil and gas program is antiquated: many of the oil and gas rules for federal public lands are decades old and prioritize oil and gas leasing and development over other important uses and values. This broken system allows oil and gas companies to boost their own paychecks while taxpayers and local communities pay a heavy price. <br/><br/>The proposed new rules would make the system more fair by increasing royalty rates and ensuring that bonds reflect the costs of plugging a well and reclaiming the surface, thereby ensuring that reclamation responsibilities reside primarily with oil and gas lessees and operators and not the American public. The proposal would also reduce conflict between drilling and other uses and values on federal public lands, including cultural, natural, and outdoor recreation resources. Our public lands support New Mexicans way of life by providing wildlife habitat, clean air and drinking water, opportunities to hunt, fish, and recreate, and conservation opportunities. <br/><br/>New Mexicans are counting on the Biden administration to listen to the public and finalize the strongest possible reforms as soon as possible to protect taxpayers, support wildlife, and ensure that our public lands and minerals are better managed to benefit all uses, not just oil and gas development. As the BLM works to finalize these essential new rules, the BLM should also consider climate goals and the greenhouse gas impacts of oil and gas development. While I strongly support the BLMs responsible proposal to modernize the oil and gas leasing program, moving forward the BLM must prioritize the expansion of clean energy over fossil fuels to meet our energy needs.

INFO - Comment: I am writing to support the concerns raised in the petition submitted by Beyond Pesticides and Food and Water Watch regarding the prevalence of the toxic pesticide triclosan in consumer products. Research has shown that triclosan poses a threat to human health, contaminates water, and persists in the environment. EPA has a responsibility under the law to protect the health of the public and the environment and must move to do so now. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) finds triclosan concentrations are increasing in the human population, and triclosan in consumer products is causing involuntary exposure directly and through environmental contamination. Triclosan has been linked to:<br/><br/>- endocrine disruption as it interferes with the thyroid, estrogen, and androgen hormones and as a result can impact fetal development<br/>- bacterial resistance and possible cross-resistance to antibiotics<br/>- contaminated biosolids that are used for compost and agricultural fertilizer<br/>- toxic and persistent breakdown products including dioxins<br/> <br/>Since triclosan is no more effective than regular soap and water at reducing bacteria, there is absolutely no need for triclosan to be incorporated into consumer products, given the potential human health hazards. Please move quickly to rid this chemical from consumer products.

INFO - Comment: The leak detection and repair proposal from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration will improve safety in our communities, reduce economic losses from leaked gas, and protect our planet by reducing methane emissions that contribute to the climate crisis. PHMSA must act quickly to finalize comprehensive standards for gas pipelines.<br/><br/>Important elements of this proposal include requiring more frequent leak surveys, faster leak repair times, use of more advanced technologies and equipment for detecting leaks, minimizing intentional venting and blowdowns and increasing the quality and availability of data available to the public.<br/><br/>PHMSA should improve the proposal in the following ways. First, operators should be required to find and fix leaks on all gas-gathering pipelines. Right now, there are hundreds of thousands of gathering pipelines that are not subject to minimum maintenance requirements, presenting an environmental and safety risk. The proposal would address some but not all of these pipelines  PHMSA should close this gap and require operators to manage leaks on all gathering lines. <br/><br/>Second, PHMSA should set clear and rigorous definitions for leak detection technology performance, to ensure that operators have clarity regarding which equipment satisfies the advanced methane detection standard that will maximize leak identification. The proposal provides broad discretion to operators in implementing leak detection and repair programs, which could result in confusion and suboptimal outcomes. <br/><br/>Third, PHMSA should adopt clear and strong well integrity standards that include standards for infrastructure and monitoring to prevent leaks as well as leak detection and repair standards for the nations 400 underground natural gas storage facilities and associated pipeline infrastructure.<br/><br/>Finally, I ask that PHMSA not provide an exemption for soon-to-be-replaced pipes. Older pipes are known for leaking more, but the proposal would allow operators to ignore identified gas leaks for as long as five years if the pipe segment is scheduled for replacement. To ensure safety and reduce harmful methane emissions, operators should be required to address known leaks even if the pipeline will eventually be replaced.   <br/><br/>Another piece that could be improved is expanding information reported by pipeline operators. With more data and transparency, we can better mitigate the harm by current pipelines and we can set out a better plan for future actions.<br/><br/>We should seize this opportunity to support cost-effective and common-sense standards that protect both our communities and our climate. This proposal is strong, but I know we can make it stronger to set our country up for success in the years to come.

INFO - Comment: Dear Director Stone-Manning,<br/><br/>Thank you for initiating a plan to bring balance to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). I support the Public Lands Rule and encourage you to strengthen it to help ensure a vibrant future for western communities' water supplies, wildlife and way of life that make the region unique.<br/><br/>America's public lands offer some of the most readily available, fiscally responsible solutions to address drought, storm impacts, catastrophic fire and nature loss that are causing rapid changes in the West. For more than 40 years the BLM has prioritized resource extraction over other uses on public lands that are home to over 3,000 species, including migrating big game, upland game birds and waterfowl. Numerous wildlife species occur nowhere else in the country.<br/><br/>It's time to balance BLM's approach and elevate conservation to help sustain the nation's iconic open landscapes of the West that drive tourism, offer refuge for wildlife, provide public access to nature, and safeguard innumerable stories of human experiences on the land. Expanding co-stewardship with Tribal Nations will bring traditional knowledge and incorporate Indigenous expertise to decision-making to ensure these lands remain healthy and support us in the future. <br/><br/>While the draft rule is an important step forward, I believe it will need strengthening prior to its finalization. In particular, the rule should:<br/><br/>- Require the identification and protection of habitat connectivity areas. <br/>- Facilitate ecological integrity and climate resiliency across all forest-types by conserving old and mature forests from logging, wildfire and climate change, informed by the best available science and Indigenous knowledge.<br/>- Ensure that, prior to approving any development, the BLM has conducted an inventory of intact natural landscapes, including lands with wilderness characteristics, and determined that the action will not degrade any intact natural landscape.<br/>- Ensure that all eligible areas that meet the criteria are designated as Areas of Critical Environmental Concern and are properly managed.<br/>- Require the BLM to consult with Tribes to ensure it fully advances opportunities for co-stewardship, incorporation of Indigenous Knowledge, respect for Tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, protection of Tribal cultural sites, and carrying out Tribal consultation in ways that honor the unique historic and current connections of Native Americans to public lands.<br/><br/>I'm grateful for this Administration's commitment to conserving and restoring America's public lands and supporting the communities that depend on them. Now is the time to act for the critical places that are the backbone of the West. Please strengthen the Public Lands Rule and work swiftly to bring balance to BLM-managed landscapes.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Janet Ma'ly<br/>Summit Argo, IL 60501

INFO - Comment: As one of 250,000 In Defense of Animals supporters and someone who cares deeply about wild animals, I urge you not to go through with this rule.<br/><br/>The Endangered Species Act is one of the world’s most powerful legal tools for protecting species from extinction and has an impressive success rate of 99%. If this rule goes through it would essentially gut the ESA and cause massive harm to the species it protects. Most certainly, species would go extinct because of this change. <br/><br/>Often, endangered and threatened species are endangered or threatened because of a threat to their habitat. A species cannot survive without a home. Science shows that habitat loss is a leading cause of species extinction. When members of a species lose habitat, they lose shelter, breeding grounds, and access to food. To propose that the destruction of habitat does not harm a species goes against science and common sense. Because of this definition change, the crucial habitats that endangered animals need to survive could be opened up to logging, mining, development, and other activities that would threaten already endangered species. To save a species, the habitat the animal relies upon must be protected. <br/><br/>It is important to keep the term “harm” defined as it is so that the ESA can continue to have a 99% success rate of saving species. <br/><br/>Thank you for considering this comment.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Dr. Janice Jones<br/>Littleton, CO 80120-4334

The science is clear: the impacts of the federal hydroelectric dams, compounded by climate change, are accelerating the risk of extinction for salmon (and orcas that feed on them) by killing juvenile and adult salmon and steelhead and raising river temperatures well above lethal levels.   <br/><br/>The Biden administration must build off of the strong foundation laid by Senator Patty Murray, Governor Jay Inslee, Representative Mike Simpson and others. We urgently call for a comprehensive plan and action for Columbia Basin salmon restoration that:  <br/><br/>*Acknowledges the urgent need to recover abundant and healthy salmon populations as stated by the Columbia Basin Partnership and NOAA’s Rebuilding Report and commits to an expedited timeline.    <br/><br/>*Clearly outlines a path that can lead to breaching the lower Snake River dams as soon as possible, provide fish passage into blocked areas, reintroduce salmon in the upper Columbia River, and fund  habitat restoration work throughout the Columbia River Basin.   <br/><br/>*Commits to immediate actions to replace the services the dams currently provide with salmon-friendly options (energy, transportation, irrigation). <br/><br/>*Commits to producing by Fall 2024 a supplemental EIS, BiOp and final decision to meet the Biden Administration’s commitments and restore healthy, abundant salmon.   <br/><br/>*Upholds the federal government’s legally-binding commitments to Northwest Tribal Nations and honors the promises made to them in treaties, trusts, and other responsibilities.  <br/><br/>We must act quickly and decisively, before Northwest salmon and steelhead are lost forever.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>K Krupinski<br/>1722 Bay Shore Dr  Cocoa Beach, FL 32931-2314

INFO - Comment: Public Service Loan Forgiveness Regulations <br/>Docket ID ED-2021-OPE-0077<br/><br/>Dear Secretary Cardona, <br/>As a California physician, I am writing to urge the U.S. Department of Education to provide student loan forgiveness under the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program to California and Texas physicians who meet all requirements of the PSLF program and who would otherwise qualify for PSLF if it weren’t for state laws that prohibit private non-profit hospitals from directly employing physicians. <br/>Qualified California and Texas physicians should have equal access to this national loan forgiveness program like our colleagues in all other 48 states. We can meet all the PSLF standards, except we are not able to be employed by private non-profit institutions under our state laws. <br/>While state laws in California and Texas do allow public non-profit hospitals and clinics to directly employ physicians, private non-profit institutions – including community hospitals, children’s hospitals, rural hospitals and district hospitals – are prohibited from directly employing physicians. Therefore, since the inception of the PSLF program, California and Texas physicians who are otherwise qualified to receive loan forgiveness have been inadvertently excluded from a national program in which our similarly situated physician colleagues in all other states can participate. <br/>I support the proposal submitted by the California Medical Association, the California Hospital Association, the Texas Medical Association and the Texas Hospital Association that requires an additional written certification from an authorized official of the public service organization (hospital, clinic) certifying that the physician works full time (30 hours/week) in the private non-profit facility, is authorized through the clinical privileges credentialling process, but is not able to be employed by the facility because of state law. This is an additional standard for California and Texas physicians who are prohibited from being directly hired and paid by the facility. <br/>Such PSLF loan forgiveness would help many physicians who train in California and Texas to be able to remain and serve our substantial communities of vulnerable, minority and marginalized patients. It would also help low-income minority students afford medical school and return to their underserved communities to practice and serve in non-profit hospitals and clinics. PSLF equity in California and Texas would ensure racial equity in education and health care equity in underserved areas. <br/>With medical student loan debt averaging $200,000 in addition to undergraduate debt, the PSLF program is essential to encourage more students to become physicians and address the physician workforce shortages that are harming patient access to timely care. California and Texas are projected to have the largest physician shortages over the next decade due to a significant increase in our populations, an increase in elderly and sicker patients, and an aging physician workforce nearing retirement. Exclusion from PSLF will exacerbate our physician shortages and patient access to care challenges as physicians will choose to practice in other states where they can access the PSLF program. <br/>You might be wondering why California and Texas do not change these laws that are preventing physicians from participating in the PSLF program. Our state laws are critically important and protect against corporate, non-physician entities employing physicians and making medical decisions. This corporate bar on the practice of medicine is a critically important law that protects and preserves the independence of physicians’ professional judgment in the care of their patients and ensures that external forces cannot interfere with the physician-patient relationship. <br/>I urge the Department to adopt the alternative proposal for California and Texas that maintains the integrity of our state laws, while being consistent with the PSLF statute and program standards. <br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>Laura Kenkel, MD<br/>Associate Clinical Professor<br/>Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health <br/>University of California Davis Medical Center<br/><br/>

INFO - Comment: Dear Mr. Rauch, and Mr. Barnette,<br/><br/>I am writing today to support the National Marine Fisheries Services advance notice of proposed rulemaking, which proposes to expand the requirement to use Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) on vessels less than 40 feet in the southeast U.S. shrimp fisheries and requests public input on impacts. The Fisheries Service should expand the TEDs rule to require 3-inch bar spacing TEDs on all trawls in the shrimp fisheries of the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.<br/><br/>All six sea turtle species found in U.S. waters are listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Sea turtles face significant threats from commercial fishing. Sea turtles, which require air to breathe, can get caught in fishing nets as bycatch, non-target catch, and be harmed or even drowned. According to the Fisheries Services own estimates, under the rules currently in place, Southeast U.S. shrimp trawl nets come into contact with endangered or threatened sea turtles over half-a-million times a year, resulting in as many as 50,000 sea turtles deaths. If used properly, TEDs provide an escape hatch in the fishing nets that can reduce sea turtle bycatch by as much as 97 percent. And, narrower, 3-inch bar spacing TEDs protect small, juvenile sea turtles. At least 50 percent more sea turtles could be saved with the expansion of the TEDs rule to all shrimp trawling vessels in the Southeast.<br/><br/>In addition to saving sea turtles, TEDs have been proven to reduce bycatch of other marine life, including recreationally and commercially valuable fish. Moreover, expanding use of TEDs is beneficial to shrimp fishers, who will likely spend less time sorting out the targeted shrimp from non-target species, may have reduced fuel costs due to reduction of drag, and will likely benefit from broader markets if the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch removes the red-listing for the fishery.<br/>With more sea turtles alive and well due to expanded TEDs use, locals and tourists in the Southeast region can observe sea turtles on land  through guided nesting walks and rehabilitation release events  as well as in the water through scuba diving. Coastal economies in the Southeast benefit from sea turtle tourism, which attracts over 500,000 visitors annually.<br/><br/>Expanding 3-inch bar spacing TEDs to all trawls in the U.S. southeast shrimp fishery not only provides necessary protections for endangered and threatened sea turtles, as required by the Endangered Species Act, but also benefits fishers, coastal communities, and visitors to the Southeast region. I urge you to fully and effectively implement this common-sense, win-win solution: expand the TEDs rule to require 3-inch bar spacing TEDs on all trawls in the shrimp fisheries of the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Tika Bordelon

INFO - Comment: The Endangered Species Act is one of our nation's most successful laws. In its current state, it has been more than 99 percent successful at stopping extinction. It is supported by a bipartisan majority and has been an economic driver by supporting recovery of species that support non-consumptive recreation.<br/><br/>I am writing to urge you to reconsider the recent proposed rule that would expand the Fish and Wildlife Services (FWS) ability to exclude areas essential to the conservation of threatened and endangered species from designation as critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). <br/><br/>This proposed rule would reverse FWS' 2016 critical habitat policy position that FWS will generally not exclude Federal lands from critical habitat designations. Instead, it would give permittees and licensees on federal lands the ability to demand FWS review proposed critical habitat designations for potential economic impacts. By stating that FWS shall exclude area when the economic costs of designating them outweigh the benefits, the proposed rule is actually more restrictive than the ESA itself, which states the agency "may" exclude those areas. <br/><br/>The proposed rule would also give undue weight to evidence offered by state, local governments, private interests, and expert or "firsthand" sources. The proposed rule would require FWS to prioritize that information over FWS information unless the agency has information specifically rebutting it. This could allow non-federal entities  including those who may not have conservation goals in mind  to effectively drive critical habitat designations.    <br/><br/>Protection of habitat is central to the conservation of imperiled species. The purpose of the ESA is to conserve "the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend," as well as to protect and recover endangered species and threatened species themselves. Critical habitat designations advance the ESA's recovery goals by striking a science-driven balance between conservation and economic activity. This proposed rule would hinder, not help, the ability of FWS to protect species and the ecosystems they depend upon.<br/><br/>Please reconsider and withdraw this ill-conceived rule. <br/><br/>Sincerely,

Building on the historic progress of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, this rule proposes limiting added sugars in school meals for the very first time. School meals that are limited in added sugars and sodium and contain whole grains can help introduce healthy eating habits and can help mitigate chronic health conditions.<br/><br/>Added Sugars: School breakfasts are far too sugary, and I applaud the USDA’s proposed cap of no more than 10 percent of calories from added sugars, which mirrors the Dietary Guidelines recommendation. I also support USDA’s product-specific added sugars limits.  <br/><br/>Sodium: While these sodium reduction goals represent progress, the final limits do not go far enough and are out of alignment with the Dietary Guidelines’ quantitative recommendations. For instance, children up to age 8 will get 83 percent of their daily recommended sodium limit from breakfast and lunch combined, leaving just 17 percent leftover for snacks and dinner. A 13-year-old will get 77 percent of their daily limit from school breakfast and lunch, and high school students will get 63 percent.<br/><br/>Whole Grains: The two options proposed by the USDA require less than half of grains offered be whole, which is not aligned with the Dietary Guidelines’ recommendations. I encourage the USDA to strengthen the whole grain-rich requirement.<br/><br/>Healthy, wholesome meals provide children the nutrients they need to grow, develop and learn in and out of the classroom, and the 30 million kids who rely on school meals every day deserve better.

INFO - Comment: Alan Risenhoover, Office of Sustainable Fisheries, NMFS I am writing to urge that the National Marine Fisheries Service withdraw its proposed rule regarding Magnuson-Stevens Act Environmental Review Procedures and develop a new rule that complies with National Environmental Policy Act  requirements. Instead of simplifying the environmental review process under the Magnuson-Stevens and ensuring its consistency with NEPA, the proposed rule complicates the process and violates the most basic NEPA requirements. This proposal has at least four major flaws. First, it creates confusing, unnecessary new paperwork, the Integrated Fishery Environmental Management Statement, as a substitute for the well-known Environmental Impact Statement required under NEPA. The Statement is vaguely defined and appears to contradict several NEPA requirements, paving the way for confusion, noncompliance, and litigation over what the statute and regulations really require. This is wholly contrary to Congress's intent when it directed the Service to simplify the Magnuson-Stevens environmental review process. A far simpler approach would be to retain the EIS as it is defined under NEPA as the applicable review document for Magnuson-Stevens environmental review.  Second, the proposed rule contains a number of "frameworking provisions" and expanded use of categorical exclusions that would enable fishery managers to avoid environmental review or public participation for a broad spectrum of fishery management actions. This violates the central intent of NEPA to ensure meaningful public participation in the management of public resources like fisheries. The Service should eliminate the "frameworking" approach and use existing streamlining mechanisms by preparing adequate EISs and tiering subsequent reviews from these thorough initial documents. In addition, the agency should narrow the scope of categorical exclusions to ensure that actions that may cause significant environmental impacts do not escape environmental review.  Third, the proposed rule further shuts the public out of the process by allowing fishery managers to cut short public comment periods from the currently required 45 days to as little as 14 days. Again, this violates NEPA's most basic public participation requirements. The minimum comment periods required by NEPA should be retained.  Finally, the proposed rule illegally hands over authority to conduct environmental review to fishery management councils, many of whose appointed members represent the commercial and recreational fishers being regulated and who have a substantial financial interest in the fisheries being managed. NEPA imposes binding requirements on government bodies. The Fisheries Service may not delegate away its responsibilities to provide sound, thorough, and accountable environmental review to a nongovernmental advisory body. Any new proposed regulations must make clear that the agency is the lead agency for the environmental review process and is responsible for ensuring that the process complies with NEPA requirements.  In sum, the Service's proposed regulations regarding environmental review under the Magnuson-Stevens violate the bedrock requirements of NEPA and run counter to the Magnuson-Stevens reauthorization. I strongly urge the agency to withdraw this thoroughly flawed rule and develop a new proposed rule that complies with both the Magnuson-Stevens and NEPA.

These changes would drastically weaken the interagency consultation provision of the Endangered Species Act -- widely considered the most important and effective provision of the Act -- and also undercut the Endangered Species Act's proper role in addressing the impacts of climate change on our nation's most imperiled wildlife. <br/><br/>For 35 years the Endangered Species Act has protected imperiled species from the effects of potentially harmful federal projects. The strength of the Endangered Species Act has been the checks and balances created by interagency consultation between federal agencies that build roads, issue logging permits, and lease oil and gas rights among other projects, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and National Marine Fisheries Services, whose primary responsibility is the conservation of endangered species. <br/><br/>Interagency consultation ensures that federal projects that may impact America's most imperiled wildlife are independently reviewed by federal wildlife experts and project modifications are made where necessary. In the overwhelming majority of consultations federal projects move forward with little or no significant changes.<br/><br/>The regulations you recently proposed would eliminate interagency consultation on thousands of federal projects that pose a risk to endangered and threatened species each year. The changes will almost certainly result in detrimental impacts on endangered and imperiled species and a higher propensity to overlook opportunities to avoid such impacts.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the fact that these are the most significant changes to regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act in more than 20 years, you have provided the public just 30 days in which to submit comments, not the traditional 90, and prevented anyone from sending their comments by email. <br/><br/>I request you set an additional 60 days to allow the public an opportunity to meaningfully comment on these proposed regulations.<br/><br/>I also urge you to not to finalize these regulatory changes. <br/><br/>Thank you.

The whole point of having national standards is to ensure decent basic standards for all workers. The updated overtime standard is already linked to the lowest-wage Census region.

INFO - Comment: I support the Environmental Protection Agencys Air Quality State Implementation Plan for the Pennsylvania portion of the Philadelphia area because I think that its a step in the right direction for reducing air toxins in the Philadelphia area. As a resident of Bucks County, PA, Im concerned about the air pollutants emitted in my area. Reclassifying the Pennsylvania portion of the Philadelphia area as an attainment area indicates that its meeting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). This plan also sets goals for future emissions levels in my area.<br/>Table 3 shows that the Pennsylvania portion of the Philadelphia area emitted 123,390 tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in 2007 (EPA, 2015). According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, nitrogen oxides include gases such as nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, and the majority of NOx gases are emitted by motor vehicles (ATSDR, 2011). The EPAs plan references regulations that aim to reduce motor vehicle emissions such as the Pennsylvania Clean Vehicles Program and the Diesel-Powered Motor Vehicle Idling Act. More regulations like these acts should be implemented to help reduce NOx emissions in the Philadelphia area.<br/>Table 6b lists the expected emissions of NOx in the Pennsylvania portion of the Philadelphia area in 2025 as 40,823 tons, a significant reduction compared to the 2007 level. Im also encouraged by the ten-year predictions for sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM) set forth in this plan. Sulfur dioxide is associated with human health effects such as asthma and other breathing problems (NIOSH, 2015). Particulate matter can also lead to irritation of the respiratory system (CDC, 2014). Therefore, I fully support the emissions goals that are outlined in this plan for the Pennsylvania portion of the Philadelphia area. Table 6a lists the estimated emissions of PM in 2025 as 1,436 tons, which would be a significant improvement from the 2007 rate of 12,678 tons (EPA, 2015). Additionally, SO2 emissions levels are estimated to reduce from 29,460 tons in 2007 to 9,060 tons by 2025 (EPA, 2015). These emissions projections were provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and approved by the EPA. As the EPA has determined that its possible for the Pennsylvania portion of the Philadelphia area to meet these projections, I agree that this area can work towards remaining at or below the emissions levels necessary for attainment status and support approval of this plan. <br/><br/>References<br/>Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

E-bikes should be treated as motorbikes, not bicycles. New e-bikes are being developed now that will drive up to 55 mph. E-bikes should instead travel only where motor vehicles are allowed.<br/><br/>2. Because of their speed and quiet nature, e-bikes can travel much farther into the backcountry, and startle and disturb wildlife over far greater distances.<br/><br/>3. Because of their speed and quiet nature, e-bikes also conflict with other non-motorized trail users like hikers, horseback riders, and bicyclists.<br/><br/>4. Because there is almost no enforcement now for trespass, illegal off-trail riding, and illegal trail development by some bikers, e-bikes will increasingly trespass into Wilderness and other protected areas with no consequences. This illegal use will degrade the wild character of these lands and should not be permitted.

INFO - Comment: I am a member of the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers out of Local Local 13 Nevada in Nevada. I agree with the Department of Labor's proposal to exempt the construction industry from Industry Recognized Apprenticeship Programs (IRAPs). As an IUBAC member who has worked in the construction industry, I know first-hand the connection between high-quality training, worksite safety and projects getting done on time and under budget. It's why we are the "Best Hands in the Business".<br/><br/>In registered apprenticeship programs like the one my union offers, you get the best training in the construction industry. In the classroom and on-the-job, you get years of state-of-the-art construction skills training in the business. Once an apprentice reaches journey-level status, you can pick up and move anywhere in the country and use your skills to get a good job and provide for your family. Allowing training programs that don't meet the standards required of registered programs would undercut my training and effort. High quality training is so important that I am proud to say part of my hourly wage pays for training future generations of apprentices as well as upgrade training for journey-level workers.<br/><br/>If an industry that comprises less than 4% of the workforce is producing half of the nation's apprentices, it means that the apprenticeship system in that industry is more than just getting it done - it should be a model for the rest of the country. <br/><br/>I support the Department of Labor's decision to keep industry programs out of construction so that future generations of apprentices will receive the same excellent skills training I received. <br/><br/>Raymond  Keen

INFO - Comment: Acting Director, NMFS James Balsiger    Dear Acting Director, NMFS Balsiger,  I'm deeply concerned about the impact of your agency's fishery management decisions on ocean ecosystems. I believe that strong environmental review is critical to the health of our oceans.   The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has made it possible to protect thousands of square miles of deep sea coral formations, save the lives of endangered sea turtles, begin rebuilding of depleted fish populations and facilitate meaningful public participation in fisheries management.  Unfortunately your agency's proposed NEPA rule hands over too much authority to fishery management councils that have a long history of poor management, significantly limits the public's ability to participate in fishery management decisions, and allows fishery managers to make decisions without fully considering the impacts on marine ecosystems including sea turtles, seals, corals and other precious ocean life.  Please withdraw this flawed NEPA proposal and craft a new one that will ensure protection of our ocean ecosystems. Our oceans are in trouble. I've seen in my own life how decades of mismanagement have degraded the oceans. It's time for our nation's fisheries managers to make better decisions by fully understanding the consequences of fishing on marine ecosystems.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

INFO - Comment: Andrew Saul,<br/><br/>The proposed rule you are considering will drastically increase denials of Social Security Disability benefits.  It will cause seriously ill individuals to lose desperately needed benefits, the vast majority of whom will not be able to replace the income from SSDI with earnings.  The large increase in disability reviews in this proposal will result in unwarranted denials.  <br/><br/>A similar approach was taken under the Reagan Administration, with such inhumane results that the policy was reversed after a public outcry when its harm became known.  The Reagan Administration terminated benefits of 315,000 people.  Nearly two-thirds of these denials were reversed.  Among those who lost benefits, 21,176 died.  <br/><br/>The Reagan Administration then and the current Administration now assume those denied will go to work, but studies, including research cited in the proposed rule itself, show that only a small minority will have even modest earnings.  At least two-thirds or more will not be able to work because their health impairments are severe.  With the evidence of the aborted Reagan policy and of more recent research showing clearly the harmful consequences of the rule, it is incomprehensible that it is now being put forward.  I strongly urge you to withdraw this proposed rule. <br/><br/>Rosemary Graf<br/>peneople777@gmail.com<br/>6C Walker Rd<br/>Cummington, Massachusetts 01026

This change has serious implications for acupuncturists and my ability to prescribe medications my patients need for their health care. Homeopathy is in the scope of practice of all licensed physicians in the U.S., while three states specifically license homeopathic physicians, and 24 states explicitly include it in the scope of practice of licensed naturopaths and/or acupuncturists. The Draft Guidance is affecting my ability to access homeopathic medicines and conflicts with states' authority over the practice of medicine.<br/><br/>Therefore, I urge you to adopt a policy that adheres to the law either by A) implementing the regulatory framework offered in a currently pending Citizen Petition submitted in June 2020 by Americans for Homeopathy Choice, a consumer organization whose goals I support, or by B) rescinding the Draft Guidance and working with stakeholders on a policy that does not subvert the regulatory process, which is intended to allow the affected public to have a role in shaping new regulations and have access to the courts to challenge them once adopted.

I am proud of the work we do every day to make sure menthol cigarettes and other tobacco products are sold only to adults 21 and older.  Please do not move forward with this unfair proposal that could harm tobacco retailers across the United States by shifting many of these products to illegal sellers that don't care who they sell to or how they do it.<br/><br/>If implemented, this proposal could hurt retailers and wholesalers in the U.S. and directly impact my bottom line.  This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue; menthol cigarettes alone make up 36% of all cigarette sales in the United States.   Additionally, adult customers who purchase menthol cigarettes also purchase gas, food, and other items that my store depends on.<br/><br/>It makes no sense to end the sale of these products through licensed retail stores like mine.  Bans could shift sales to illegal markets where many consumers can still get them, but without any regulatory protection or underage prevention. Flavor bans create illegal markets that could endanger the public with bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access, crime, arrests, and community conflict.<br/><br/>Underage use of menthol cigarettes is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21 -- not with bans that create illegal markets.  Responsible, licensed retailers like me have worked hard to comply with age-verification requirements, and these efforts are a big reason why underage rates have fallen so low.<br/><br/>I respectfully urge you to reconsider a ban on menthol cigarettes, and instead focus on more positive solutions that respect the role of responsible, legal businesses like mine.  Instead of banning products for adults, the government should be giving adult smokers more information and choices for lower risk tobacco products -- as well as continuing to focus on underage prevention and education.<br/>

The proposed “4(d) rule” will protect oceanic whitetip sharks from the main threats to their existence—unsustainable commercial fishing and trade of fins and other parts. <br/><br/>Overfishing has caused global oceanic whitetip numbers to plummet by an estimated 80 to 99 percent. Targeted catch and incidental bycatch in commercial fisheries remain the greatest worldwide threats to the species. In addition, the species’ distinctive fins are highly valued in the international shark fin trade, providing a destructive incentive for fishing vessels to kill oceanic whitetip sharks caught as bycatch so they can sell their fins. <br/><br/>Inadequate regulatory mechanisms allow far too many oceanic whitetip sharks to be caught, injured, and killed every year. Even though the species has been listed as a threatened species since 2018, it has continued to decline. As the proposed rule recognizes, the oceanic whitetip shark cannot survive and recover unless it is protected from unsustainable fishing and trade. The proposed rule will give the species essential protections against take and provide additional means to combat the illegal shark fin trade in the U.S. It is our responsibility as ocean stewards to recover this magnificent species to healthy levels and restore its role as a key part of marine ecosystems. <br/><br/>For all of these reasons, I urge the Fisheries Service to adopt the 4(d) rule to fully protect oceanic whitetip sharks from take and trade.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Dixie Frei<br/>Eliot, ME

INFO - Comment: US Fish and Wildlife Service Public  Comments (Grizzly Bear),<br/><br/>I am writing to express my strong support for maintaining federal protections for grizzly bears under the Endangered Species Act. Grizzly bears are an iconic species of American wilderness, yet have been decimated to a fraction of their historical population size and range. Decades of conservation efforts have kept the few remaining grizzly bears from going extinct. However, they still face significant threats from isolation, habitat loss, human-caused death, and climate change. Continued protections are essential to the long-term recovery and survival of grizzly bears.<br/><br/>I support the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rule that would maintain federal E.S.A. protections for the grizzly bear, which have been the key to preventing their extinction. Grizzly bears are a keystone species that play a critical role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem balance. They hold great ecological and cultural importance- to lose these species would be devastating. The best available science tells us that their long-term recovery depends on treating all grizzly populations as part of a single, interconnected species rather than as isolated groups. I support the Service’s decision to consider grizzly bears as a single distinct population segment in the lower 48. This will allow for a more comprehensive and holistic conservation strategy.<br/><br/>However, I am concerned about two aspects of the proposed rule. Firstly, I do not support the loosened protections that will allow for greater grizzly bear killing in livestock conflicts. The USFWS should be requiring the use of non-lethal strategies to mitigate bear-livestock conflicts. Research and real-world trials show us that non-lethal deterrents are highly effective in preventing conflicts- allowing both grizzly bears and ranchers to co-exist.  Secondly, the rule limits recovery zones

The new rules will likely alleviate the financial burden that has been placed on taxpayers for far too long. In the West we understand that fossil fuel development will continue for some time; we also understand that without proper oversight, we'll be left with the responsibility to clean up the mess. BLM's current rules fail to ensure that reclamation occurs in a complete way, and oil and gas companies have proven time and time again that without the proper incentive, they will abandon or sell their wells before cleaning them up.<br/><br/>For decades, the lack of sufficient reclamation bonds and oversight has left communities throughout the West to bear many impacts of oil and gas production, including many impacts that could have been avoided or mitigated. Many westerners live and often farm or ranch on land that overlies federal minerals. If they don't own the mineral rights, they often don't have any say in how oil companies use their property. When, as often happens, the companies orphan their wells or file for bankruptcy, the remaining infrastructure impedes ranching and other uses of the land. Unreclaimed wells can also leak toxic chemicals into groundwater, or damage the land. This often leads to a loss in livelihoods in the case of farmers and ranchers, or degraded health in the cases of rural communities.<br/><br/>I urge BLM to swiftly and effectively implement this common-sense rule to ensure communities like mine are protected from preventable harms from current and future oil and gas development.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms Deborah  Hanson<br/>ND

INFO - Comment: Our national monuments and public lands and waters help define who we are as a nation by telling the story of our historical, cultural and natural heritage. I am extremely disappointed that President Trump has signed an executive order that attempts to undermine our national monuments. Attempts to roll back protections for national monuments would be both illegal and terribly misguided. I strongly urge you to oppose any efforts to eliminate or shrink our national monuments.<br/><br/>I am vocally opposed to and disappointed in Secretary Zinke's interim recommendation to reduce the boundaries of Bears Ears National Monument. I truly hope that the Secretary will reconsider and instead act to keep all of our national monuments protected as they are.<br/><br/>Rio Grande del Norte National Monument and Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in New Mexico are truly some of the treasures of our state. The monuments protect archaeological resources, stunning vistas, critical wildlife habitat and some of the best hunting, fishing and recreating opportunities in the region. Not only are these monuments incredibly worthy of protection, they bring enormous benefits to our state by providing opportunities for recreation and driving the outdoor recreation economy. These monuments must remain protected permanently and not diminished or revoked.<br/><br/>An attempt to attack one monument by rolling back protections-like the drastic recommendation for Bears Ears National Monument-would be an attack on them all. Sending a signal that protections for our shared history, culture, and natural treasures are not permanent would set a terrible precedent. This would discourage business investment and community growth around all national monuments while also sending the signal that our history and natural wonders are negotiable.<br/><br/>National monuments have already been shown to be tremendous drivers of the $887 billion outdoor recreation economy and businesses in gateway communities rely on the permanency of these protections when making decisions about investing in these communities. Whether at Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks or Rio Grande del Norte in New Mexico, or other monuments across the country, our national monuments should remain protected for future generations to enjoy - they are a gift that belongs to all Americans. <br/><br/>I am firmly opposed to any effort to revoke or diminish protections for National monuments and I urge you to support our public lands and waters and recommend that our current national monuments remain protected.

INFO - Comment: Dear U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,<br/><br/>As the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) offers new rules under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, I ask that you stay focused on protecting eagles and helping their populations grow.<br/><br/>Both species of eagle face ongoing threats. While greatly recovered from their nadir, Bald Eagle populations need robust legal protections to continue growing. Golden Eagles, already at precariously lower numbers, face potential population-level threats from increased wind energy development.<br/><br/>Clean, renewable energy like wind power is an important part of our fight against climate change. Properly sited, wind energy is a win for birds, people, and the planet alike. Permitting rules like this one are vital to striking a careful balance, as we harness our abundant wind without doing unnecessary damage to wildlife.<br/><br/>The final rule should include various measures to mitigate impacts to Bald and Golden Eagles. Among them: <br/><br/>- Prioritize growth of eagle populations more than speeding along the energy permitting process. Getting it right is more important than getting it done quickly.<br/>- Create no-go zones for turbines in the most important areas for eagles. No matter how much mitigation and compensation are provided, there are some areas that are too important for eagles to allow turbine construction.<br/>- Require more robust monitoring under the general wind permit. Site surveys need to be done more often than every three months and should be undertaken by third-party monitors. Wind energy companies require federal oversight.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Nancy Franzblau

INFO - Comment: Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>I commend the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Department of Interior, and the Biden administration for proposing long-needed updates to the oil and gas leasing on our federal public lands. Today's federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>The policies outlined in the rule propose a more balanced approach to managing our shared resources. Applying the rule's &quot;leasing criteria&quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &quot;speculative leasing.&quot; Our country's current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>Additionally, there is an opportunity to strengthen the ruleWhile these measures will ensure that the B is LM better manages all of its resources, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing &ndash; whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets &ndash; are excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation. Without a bonding increase, when large oil and gas developers sell wells to smaller local operators, funds are not available to update well pad equipment or restore spent wells, and the burden falls on taxpayers and local residents.<br/><br/>The BLM's new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas. Additionally, the rule requires increased oversight of idled wells which will protect taxpayers from cleaning up future messes, and ensure that nearby public land communities will have a future.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule's implementation of the onshore oil and gas program reforms included in recent legislation. The proposed rule permanently increases the fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, bringing those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. While legislation mandates that these rates and fees remain the same until 2032, the proposed rule rightfully allows those rates to increase after that year. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and mi<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr Stephen Giger<br/>2487 S Ola Vis Apt B San Clemente, CA 92672-4303

INFO - Comment: Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Rule to Modify Pelagic Longline Bluefin Tuna Area-Based and Weak Hook Management Measures. The Gulf of Mexico is the only major spawning area for western Atlantic bluefin and must be protected. Therefore, we strongly urge NOAA Fisheries to support Alternative C1: No Action for the Gulf Gear Restricted Areas (GRAs) to keep in place these proven conservation measures. <br/><br/>The western population of Atlantic bluefin tuna is severely depleted, and science predicts the population will decline further due to higher international catch limits adopted in 2017. Now is not the time to weaken bluefin protections.<br/><br/>The Gulf GRAs have exceeded expectations for their reduction of unintended catching and killing of bluefin tuna. During the April through May GRA closure months, average annual bluefin tuna interactions are 82 percent lower than before the GRAs were in place. This reduction is especially significant considering more than half of all bluefin caught on longlines in the Gulf are dead at haulback. The GRAs, not the Individual Bluefin Quota system, are the best tool to avoid harmful interactions and they remain the primary reason for these dramatic declines in bluefin bycatch.<br/><br/>NOAAs Gulf GRAs play a vital role in protecting bluefin tuna when they are most vulnerable. I urge you to support Alternative C1: No Action for the Gulf Gear Restricted Areas. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Changing the poverty line would mean millions of people could be denied help with essential medical treatment, prescription drugs, food, and home heating or cooling assistance, or see reductions in that help. Low-income people see their costs go up more than most people, so shrinking the poverty line will simply define them as nonpoor and deny them the help they badly need.

CAFE standards are a simple and efficient pathway to true energy security, protecting drivers from gas price fluctuations by dramatically reducing oil demand. Strong standards will not only help protect American drivers from volatile gas prices, but will also prompt the auto industry to deliver more efficient vehicles.<br/><br/>CAFE standards incentivize manufacturers to invest in and apply technologies that improve overall vehicle fuel efficiency, saving consumers money at the pump. Industry innovation spurred by strong fuel economy standards has also prompted technology advancements that have made the current fleet of new cars and trucks in the United States the safest, cleanest, most fuel-efficient vehicles produced in our country which is good for the first owners of the vehicle and continues to offer savings into the future for drivers who buy used cars.<br/><br/>It's vital that we pass strong fuel economy standards. Compared to NHTSA's preferred alternative, the next most stringent standard (PC3LT5) would cut gasoline use and heat trapping emissions 27 percent more from vehicles sold through the 2032 model year. This translates to at least $12 billion back in the hands of consumers.<br/><br/>Strong fuel economy standards have support from the public and are critical tools in our toolbox to support household budgets and support the planet.  Again, I urge you to adopt the CAFE standards for model years 2027-2032—at least as strong as the PC3LT5.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr. John Outland<br/>Tallahassee, FL 32317

History repeatedly demonstrates that if a rule can be interpreted to restrict freedom, it will be. Americans have a fundamental right to keep and bear arms. Any suspension of this right must remain subject to the most careful due process and strictest scrutiny possible. Restrictions must be tailored to directly address the problem at hand – which in this case is those deemed a threat to themselves or others.<br/>It is the goal of every sane American to prevent dangerous people from possessing weapons. Expanding definitions does not directly address this issue, and creates other problems that will further degrade the US mental health system. It is a poor approach that will do more damage than good.

INFO - Comment: I am writing to oppose Mystic Aquarium's application to import five beluga whales from Marineland for research (84 FR 52072). The proposed import is illegal under both the US Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and Canadian law, and it should not go forward. Any research important for beluga conservation can be conducted at Marineland, eliminating the need to transfer any whales across the border.<br/><br/>Each of these five whales proposed for import descends from the depleted Sakhalin Bay-Nikolaya Bay-Amur River population in the Russian Federation. The law is clear there should be no public display of marine mammals from depleted populations, even for facilities conducting bona fide research. Otherwise, the relevant MMPA exemption for importing depleted marine mammals for scientific research would be a massive loophole to get animals for public display and breeding.<br/><br/>In June 2019, amendments to Canadian law made displaying cetaceans for entertainment purposes illegal, placing prohibitions on import/export and breeding. Again, scientific research is an exemption for transfers, but not for breeding. This proposal would push both Canada's new federal law--and the relevant provisions of the MMPA--to the breaking point. Mystic should respect the law. It can and should leave the whales where they are, work with Marineland to make the animals' conditions better, and conduct the research there, with a much larger sample size.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Mystic's suggestion that moving five whales will alleviate overcrowding at Marineland is a red herring. Marineland has over 50 whales; they are indeed in overcrowded conditions, but this has been their home for some time. Removing five whales will not change much at Marineland--adding five whales to the three Mystic already has, plus any that may come from breeding, would arguably lead to overcrowding there. Add to that the known stressors of transfer and adjusting to a new social group (determined from research done by Mystic, no less!) and the minuses outweigh any pluses.<br/><br/>For these reasons, and more, I strongly urge the agency to deny this permit application.

INFO - Comment: Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers. <br/><br/>The ATF’s proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized. <br/><br/>1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale—or no sale at all—might require a license:<br/><br/>ATF’s rule claims that the agency has opted not to "establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year" that require licensure, and instead suggests that "even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."<br/>However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who "regular[ly]" and "repetitive[ly]" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple "firearms." <br/><br/>2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:<br/><br/>Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted "occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby." According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be "engaged in the business" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF’s rule provides no such assurances.<br/><br/>3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:<br/><br/>Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer—private gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court’s Caniglia decision in 2021. <br/><br/>In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called "welfare check." But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police—and the Biden administration—with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.<br/><br/>4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:<br/><br/>One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have "willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license." Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior. <br/><br/>Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF’s footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don’t! <br/><br/>5. ATF’s backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration: <br/><br/>So-called "Universal Background Checks" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime. <br/><br/>The Biden Administration described this as "moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation." And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales. <br/><br/>But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.

No one should be forced to sacrifice their religious freedom in order to qualify for basic government-funded services. <br/><br/>The proposed rule will undermine access to critical services for youth such as school lunch programs and 4-H development and mentoring programs. The rule eliminates key religious freedom protections for participants while inviting employment discrimination by the government-funded service providers that are supposed to be serving everyone. <br/><br/>This proposed rule is discriminatory and dangerous. In America, no one's access to vital services should depend on whether they share the religious beliefs of government-funded organizations. Please withdraw this harmful rule in its entirety.

INFO - Comment: I am writing in support of the rule proposed by the Office for Victims of Crime—Docket No. OJP (OVC) 1808—which would significantly increase access to compensation for crime victims, including survivors of gun violence.<br/><br/>I am writing in support of the Department of Commerce’s interim final rule—BIS-2024-0003 (RIN 0694-AJ46)— to tighten restrictions on firearm exports and urge the Department to finalize it as written. <br/><br/>The United States has long suffered from an epidemic of gun violence. Gun violence takes more than 43,000 lives in the United States in an average year. Of those gun deaths, 17,730 are gun homicides. Our gun homicide rate is 26 times that of other high-income countries. That, alone, is unacceptable. <br/><br/>However, due to weak controls and even weaker oversight, the United States also has an unfortunate record of exporting our gun violence epidemic abroad. U.S.-made guns have too often been diverted from legal commerce to illegal commerce. As a result, these guns have ended up in the hands of terrorists, drug  cartels, and other transnational criminal organizations who have used them to facilitate drug trafficking, commit crimes and human rights abuses, stoke political violence, destabilize regions, and fuel corruption—making us and the world less safe and less secure. <br/><br/>The Department of Commerce’s rule will mean fewer dangerous exports of firearms abroad—helping to reduce these risks and, in turn, strengthen our national security, further our foreign policy interests, and protect public safety. I support this rule because the United States should not be in the business of exporting our gun violence crisis to other nations. <br/><br/>The rule will give the Department of Commerce more tools to evaluate these risks and monitor high-risk sales to foreign partners—and save lives by preventing the most high-risk exports of US-made firearms. These tools include new methods for tracking semi-automatic weapons and a formal working group with the State Department and other government agencies for vetting export license applications. In addition, the rule establishes a presumption of denial for license applications involving 36 countries where there is a substantial risk that firearms will be diverted to illegal commerce and misused. It will also enable the Department of Commerce to better recognize firearm transactions that pose heightened risks of diversion and misuse, using criteria that focuses on who the end users are, destination-specific risk factors, and the capabilities, potential uses, and lethality of the weapons to be exported. <br/><br/>I believe the Department of Commerce’s rule is a welcome and long overdue step after the previous Administration made it easier for U.S. gun manufacturers to get licenses to export firearms, including assault weapons that have been used in our deadliest mass shootings, without adequate safeguards. It is critical that the Department ensure that this interim final rule is finalized as written and implemented to further our national security and foreign policy interests and to put a stop to dangerous firearms exports that have gone unchecked for too long. In helping protect the world from gun violence, this rule will help us better protect ourselves and our communities from this epidemic, too.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Andrew Kurzweil

INFO - Comment: I am appalled that our treasured national parks and monuments, like the Bears Ears National Monument, are up for review at all. Bears Ears is one of our nation's newest monuments -- the American people are very lucky to now call this ancient site covering an expanse of 1.3 million acres a public resource protected for future generations. The monument protects ancient sites that are sacred to the Native American tribes in southern Utah's red-rock country. Utah is greatly enriched by the Bears Ears National Monument. Bears Ears National Monument also provides incredible spaces for outdoor activities-- it is one of best places in the world for rock climbing and bouldering. These public lands need to stay in public hands. No president has EVER attempted to abolish a national monument, and an attack on one park is an attack on all our parks. Secretary Zinke, I am adamantly opposed to any effort to eliminate or diminish protections for Bears Ears or any other national monument, and I urge you to support our public lands and waters and recommend that our current national monuments remain protected.

They are an indispensable economic driver for coastal and ocean communities, generating $8 billion annually through commercial fishing, tourism, and recreation activities within protected areas. By restoring fisheries, protecting against the dangers of offshore oil drilling, and providing a buffer against climate change, marine sanctuaries are critical to the entire nations economy, health, and security. <br/><br/>Since President Nixon established the National Marine Sanctuary Program, bipartisan support from communities, Congress, and presidents has been critical to designate and expand marine sanctuaries. An attack on any marine sanctuary is an attack on the very fabric of American democracy.

INFO - Comment: I applaud the Service's proposed rule to revise critical habitat designations for Florida manatees and to designate critical habitat for Antillean manatees in Puerto Rico. I urge the Service to finalize these designations in a timely manner and in accordance with the mandates of the Endangered Species Act. <br/><br/>While I’m supportive of this proposal, the Service must designate additional areas known to be critical to the recovery of the species.  <br/><br/>For one thing, the arbitrary limitation of the critical habitat to within 30 kilometers of winter manatee aggregation areas contradicts the best available science regarding manatee movement and excludes the Upper Mosquito Lagoon. This waterway is undoubtedly critical to the continued survival of Florida manatees and has provided much needed forage to mitigate deaths during the ongoing unusual mortality event.  <br/><br/>The Service is well aware of the importance of the Upper Mosquito Lagoon to the species and should include it as critical habitat in the final designation. Adjusting the criteria to include foraging areas within 50 kilometers of the identified warm-water refuges as physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the species would accomplish this goal. <br/><br/>Additionally, the Service should include Florida Power & Light's warm-water outfalls as critical habitat for the species. While I support Florida Power & Light's "Net Zero by 2045" goal, this created habitat is relied upon heavily by Florida manatees in winter months, as recognized by the Service's Florida Manatee Warm-Water Habitat Action Plan. It’s critical to work with Florida Power & Light to establish a schedule by which the company’s plants will no longer regularly utilize the outfalls, helping the agency and organizations better transition the species back to natural sources. <br/><br/>Finally, the entirety of the Ocklawaha and St. Johns Rivers should be included as critical habitat. These rivers are major travel corridors for the species and provide access to several natural warm-water sites. <br/><br/>Again, I thank the Service for taking the first step to protect Florida manatees’ habitat. I urge you expand the proposed protections in the final designation.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mary Sue Baker<br/>FL 34241-9367

The citizens of the west worked across many stakeholder communities for years to determine the appropriate size the the Bears Ears memorial.  The rights of nearby private landowners were represented as one of the stakeholding interests.  One of the interests.  There are also outdoor enthusiasts and entrepreneurs, travel and  leisure industry leaders, environmental protectors, history buffs, proponents of open space, and, very importantly, native communities who are also stakeholders.  I do not believe private land owners near the monument should be allowed to continue to dominate the national conversation about OUR FEDERAL LANDS.  It is time to recalibrate the influence that people who lease our lands to exploit our resources have over environmentally sensitive and valuable areas.<br/>  The disrespectful manner that you have dealt with native people on your recent visit to Utah is deeply disturbing to us in New Mexico.  We have worked for more than 100 years to build a political and social communtiy that honors the three main cultures<br/>that created modern New Mexico; allowing each culture to own their contributions to the success of the whole.  It is unfortunate that the political leaders in Utah could not advise you to treat the native community as a co-equal stakeholder in this review process.  Perhaps both Utah and Montana could learn from our state, where we work every day to be sure all our citizens are included in the prosperity of the state.<br/>  It seems to me the reduction of the size of this monument benefits very few people, though it would be an ideological win for the anti-government cult that is growing in our country.  I reject that thinking and urge you to leave the memorial as it is.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Gail Lujan

Any discussion of an increase in the overtime salary threshold must begin at no less than a basic national standard of $51,000 in 2020 (the updated value of the 2016 rule), which today would cover approximately 33 percent of full-time salaried workersstill below the 1975 level, but a marked improvement that would increase wages of millions of families.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Ed Dunn<br/>ejdunnjr@comcast.net<br/>4055 Lasher Road<br/>Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania 19026

INFO - Comment: As a small-business operator in Virginia, I'm very disappointed to learn that the FDA is considering a ban on licensed retailers selling menthol cigarettes to adults 21 and older. Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning menthol cigarettes could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since menthol cigarettes alone make up 36% of all cigarette sales in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of menthol could undermine my ability to operate by significantly impacting my revenue. Plain and simple: it's misguided and could force small businesses to close.<br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, menthol cigarettes could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime under the laws of all 50 states.  Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of menthol cigarettes is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.<br/>

INFO - Comment: The IRS's new rules regarding reportable transactions are an egregious violation of privacy rights. By requiring the reporting of every digital asset transaction, including those of average consumers, the IRS is overstepping its bounds and setting a dangerous precedent. This level of intrusion goes far beyond what Congress intended and is an unwarranted invasion of personal financial information. The sheer volume of data that would need to be reported is staggering, far surpassing the transactions reported by major brokerages. This excessive requirement is not only impractical but also raises serious concerns about the security and confidentiality of taxpayer data. The IRS's insistence on enforcing such minute details on taxpayer transactions is not only unreasonable but also undermines the trust and confidence that taxpayers should have in the agency. This overreach is a clear indication of the IRS's disregard for individual privacy and its overzealous pursuit of tax cheats. It is imperative that the IRS reevaluates these rules and respects the privacy rights of everyday Americans. The focus should be on pursuing bad actors and tax cheats using blockchain technology in a more targeted and reasonable manner, rather than subjecting all taxpayers to such extreme scrutiny.

I support the Department of Labor's proposal to exclude construction from Industry Programs so future construction workers will have the benefit of training in a registered program and obtain the skills they need to succeed.<br/><br/>There's not a lot of good paying jobs around here, especially that come with the best training and good pay and benefits. If construction is included in industry-registered apprenticeship programs, greedy contractors will use the program as a way to evade prevailing wage laws. They lie about whether an apprentice is actually registered. It is the only way a worker on a public-works project can make less than the prevailing wage. If this rule allows IRAPs into construction, there will be a massive hole blown in prevailing-wage laws.<br/><br/>Industry-registered apprenticeship programs are not right for the construction industry, because they would not have to adhere to the same high standards as a registered program. Existing registered apprenticeship programs ensure that apprentices receive excellent skills and safety training, which keep construction sites running efficiently and safely. Do not let an experimental system erode these standards, which have served our industry so well for so long.<br/><br/>Paul Jakobsen

INFO - Comment: Re: CMS-2018-0149-0002<br/><br/>Dear Secretary Azar and Administrator Verma,<br/><br/>As a small business community pharmacist, I am writing to voice my strong support for the administration's proposal regarding pharmacy direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees in CMS' recently proposed rule on drug pricing transparency. I share the administration's goal of lowering patient out-of-pocket costs, stabilizing the operating environment for my pharmacy, and ensuring a more competitive and efficient Part D program.  I believe the changes outlined in the proposed rule regarding DIR will accomplish these goals. Therefore, the administration should promptly finalize those changes through formal regulation. I elaborate below.<br/><br/>First, I urge the administration to finalize the proposed changes to the negotiated price definition that seeks to include all pharmacy DIR at the point of sale. This change would effectively eliminate retroactive pharmacy DIR, a change that will lower out-of-pocket spending for Medicare patients. By ensuring more predictable cash flows, it will also allow small business owners like me to continue to operate our pharmacies. As the proposed rule states, price concessions, net of all pharmacy incentive payments, have grown more than 45,000 percent between 2010 and 2017. This number, while extraordinary, is not a shock to me because I have seen firsthand how the skyrocketing rise in these fees impact patients and my small business. <br/><br/>Patients win when pharmacy price concessions are included in the negotiated price and applied at the point of sale, because this lowers the negotiated price, the benchmark by which patient cost-sharing is based. Lowering the negotiated price by including pharmacy DIR ensures that patients will not pay more out of pocket at the pharmacy counter, be pushed more rapidly through their deductible phase, and enter the donut and catastrophic phases of the Medicare Part D program more quickly. Therefore, this change would lower patient out-of-pocket costs in the Medicare program<br/><br/>Further, at my own pharmacy, the ever-increasing, unpredictable, and retroactive nature of these fees means I am unable to plan for the future of my business or even understand my current cash flow. Each time I fill a prescription for a Part D patient, I am certain that the payment indicated at the time of dispensing is not the ultimate payment I will receive. Once all DIR fees are assessed, weeks, months or even over a year later, my payment will be much lower than initially indicated. Therefore, requiring all pharmacy DIR fees be applied at point of sale would provide some needed stabilization to the operating environment at my pharmacy.<br/><br/>Second, I urge the administration to finalize changes to the negotiated price definition that would exclude contingent amounts that are positive incentive payments made to pharmacies. I believe pharmacies should be incentivized to achieve certain performance metrics via payments by Part D plan sponsors and their PBMs. Further, I believe the administration must play a role in developing or approving a standard set of performance metrics on which plans and pharmacies base their contractual agreements. The proposed changes would achieve the administration's goal of standardizing the way in which plan sponsors and their PBMs treat pharmacy price concessions. <br/><br/>Third, in providing for stabilization in the Medicare program, I urge the administration to implement safeguards that would provide for reasonable reimbursement to pharmacies participating in Medicare Part D. At my own pharmacy I often find that the reimbursement I receive is less than my pharmacy's costs (drug acquisition plus cost to dispense). I have witnessed how underwater reimbursements are often used to squeeze pharmacies out of the market. Therefore, I urge the administration to ensure that the negotiated price should at a minimum cover the pharmacy's costs of purchasing and dispensing covered items and providing covered services.<br/><br/>Finally, I thank the administration for its continued efforts to address so-called gag clauses so community pharmacists can share information with our patients. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I urge the administration to act swiftly in finalizing the proposed language to amend the definition of negotiated price to ensure that all pharmacy price concessions are accounted for at the point of sale beginning in 2020, and to develop a standard set of metrics from which plans and pharmacies will base contractual arrangements. As a community pharmacist and local business owner, I am one of America's most accessible health care providers. Finalizing these provisions will help assure that I can continue the essential role I and other community pharmacists play in serving patients in communities across this nation.<br/><br/>Thank you,

INFO - Comment: As an adult who enjoys premium cigars, I support the FDA's proposal that premium cigars be exempt from FDA regulation. I agree with much of the FDA's proposed definition of premium cigars. However, the FDA should not include a $10 minimum price requirement. In my opinion, the FDA has no role in setting prices for products it regulates. In addition, a $10 dividing line is arbitrary in defining the high-quality cigars that I enjoy. Price does not dictate whether or not a cigar is in fact premium. Premium cigars come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and prices. A $10 minimum price could result in many of the premium cigars I enjoy no longer being available, or being sold at an increased price. It would restrict my product choice while not addressing the FDA's public health goals. Therefore, I strongly believe that the FDA should remove the $10 minimum price requirement from the definition of a premium cigar.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.

INFO - Comment: Federal Register Comments,<br/><br/>Thank you for proposing this rule to require states and regions to track emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from surface transportation. We strongly support this proposal and encourage the Department of Transportation (DOT) to finalize it quickly, with the modifications suggested below.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Transportation is the largest source of GHG emissions in the United States, representing 27 percent of the nation’s emissions in 2020. More than half of these emissions come from passenger cars, light-duty trucks (including SUVs and minivans), and medium- and heavy-duty trucks. Protecting road infrastructure from the effects of climate change warrants improved plans and preparations for the future by our transportation agencies, including investments in transportation solutions which don’t exacerbate climate change such as electric vehicles and public transportation options.<br/><br/>And there is no time to waste as record amounts of federal taxpayer funds are already flowing to grantees from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The Georgetown Climate Center summed up the stakes in a recent issue brief: “IIJA could be an important part of the U.S. response to climate change. Or it could lead to more greenhouse gas pollution than the trajectory we are currently on. Where the actual outcome falls within that range will depend on the decisions made by state, federal, and local governments about how to spend the money made available by IIJA.”<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Now is the time to require federal grantees to measure and manage GHG emissions from transportation plans and programs. Only by tracking these emissions can we begin to understand and address the long-term impact that transportation investments are having on our communities and our climate. The proposed rule would empower state and local leaders to better connect their transportation decisions with climate

INFO - Comment: I'm deeply concerned that the proposed rule will cut off my access to basic preventive care and full and complete information regarding my health care options. The rule would ban trusted, Title X-funded health care providers from referring patients for abortions, and allow providers to withhold information from patients about their pregnancy options. Four million patients depend on Title X for birth control, cancer screenings, STD testing and treatment, and other critical health care. We all deserve access to full information and care no matter how much money we make or where we live. I oppose any and all policies that interfere with access to basic preventive care and demand that HHS stops this rule now.

INFO - Comment: Dear Acting Secretary Eric Hargan,<br/><br/>The Affordable Care Act guaranteed insurance coverage of birth control without additional cost.  But by allowing employers and universities to deny women birth control coverage, these rules illegally take that away from women. That's why I urge you to rescind these harmful discriminatory rules immediately.<br/><br/>You admitted not knowing the effect of these rules on individuals who lose birth control coverage. But I can tell you the effect: some women will be unable to afford the most appropriate method of birth control and others won't be able to obtain birth control at all.<br/>Birth control is basic health care - yet we know that before the Affordable Care Act guaranteed insurance coverage and eliminated out-of-pocket costs for birth control, some of the most effective forms of birth control cost as much as $1,000 upfront. And even co-pays as low as $6 kept some women from obtaining birth control.<br/><br/>Lack of birth control access is a direct oppression of women. Women must be allowed to have control over their own bodies and reproductive decisions. <br/>By allowing employers and universities to deprive women of critical birth control coverage, these rules threaten women's health and discriminate against women.<br/><br/>Employers, universities, and insurance companies should not be allowed to discriminate by using their religious or moral beliefs to block access to birth control coverage. I urge you to rescind these rules that would result in women losing seamless access to the essential coverage they need and are entitled to by law.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Maxx Follis-Goodkind<br/>  Seattle, WA 98117

INFO - Comment: I write to you not as a tobacco consumer, but as a concerned resident of Arizona who believes adults should have the right to choose what legal products they buy. I oppose the FDA's proposed ban on menthol cigarettes.  Please do not move forward with this prohibitionist rule.<br/><br/>Now that the minimum age to buy tobacco is 21, and youth use of cigarettes is at historic lows, the government should not start banning menthol cigarettes for adults 21 and older.  This is adult prohibition, plain and simple. Prohibition did not work for alcohol.  States and the federal government are debating the merits of repealing the prohibition of cannabis. Prohibition for adults doesn't work -- it never has and never will.<br/><br/>This ban will criminalize the sale of once legal products. All 50 states have laws that carry significant consequences for illicit tobacco sales.  Why would the federal government put adults in this situation? A better approach is effective regulation and education. <br/><br/>Further, bans like this one could create illegal markets that increase crime, reduce tax revenues, and hurt small business. Instead of limiting adult choices by banning legal products, the federal government should focus on giving adults the information they need to make their own decisions about these products.<br/><br/>I ask you to find other solutions that have been proven to work before prohibiting menthol cigarettes for adults.  <br/>

The expansion of access to copay-free contraception under the Affordable Care Act saved Americans more than $1.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs in the first year alone and contributed to a decline in unintended pregnancies (which cost American taxpayers $21 billion per year before the expansion of copay-free birth control) to historic lows. Birth control enables women to finish their education, get -- and keep -- good jobs, support themselves and their families financially, and invest in their childrens futures.<br/><br/>In the name of our economy, the empowerment of our citizens, and the continued progress of our society, please rescind these rules and keep birth control copay-free.

INFO - Comment: I was pleased to learn that DOT recently proposed to approve Norwegian's subsidiary, Norwegian Air International's (NAI) application for authority to fly to the United States. As a frequent traveler, I strongly encourage the DOT to act quickly and issue final approval of NAI's foreign air carrier permit. Like most consumers, I value choice when traveling and we can certainly all benefit from lower fares between the U.S. and Europe.<br/><br/>Approval of NAI's service is a win-win scenario for many reasons:<br/><br/>First, as a low-cost carrier entering the U.S.-Europe market, NAI will help make fares more affordable and incentivize all carriers to improve their service and offerings - an often overlooked, but crucial need for all travelers today. Norwegian has been offering affordable high-quality service in Europe for decades. This is a huge benefit for consumers.<br/><br/>Second, NAI will offer affordable fares between the U.S. and Europe, which will make traveling internationally a possibility for so many more hard-working Americans. Affordable service will open the leisure market and encourage tourism on both sides of the Atlantic; not only can Americans travel abroad more affordably, but more international tourists can also reach our shores, leading to massive economic benefit in the tourism and hospitality industries.Third, NAI will serve U.S. airports and communities that often are overlooked by other carriers, further increasing opportunities for international travel across the U.S. and Europe. For example, NAI has is committed to serving Las Vegas, Oakland, Fort Lauderdale, and Orlando, and will launch a new route between Boston and Cork, Ireland - never before served by a U.S. airline.<br/><br/>Fourth, Norwegian will create tens of thousands of jobs in the aviation, travel, and hospitality sectors - all of which benefit the U.S. economy.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I strongly support NAI's proposal to serve the U.S. market and encourage the federal government to quickly grant final approval of its operating certificate. By doing so, consumers like me can begin taking advantage of the affordable, high-quality service that NAI will offer, and our entire country can continue to reap the benefits of economic growth. Thank you for your consideration.

INFO - Comment: I've been an IUPAT member for years.  Completing my IUPAT apprenticeship made it possible for me to provide a middle-class life for my family. In my registered apprenticeship program, not only did I get paid more than minimum wage while I was training, I also received raises on a regular basis. This encouraged me to stay in the program until graduation. <br/><br/>Unlike my apprenticeship program, apprentices in the Industry Programs can be paid minimum wage throughout their apprenticeship. If I had made minimum wage while working construction I wouldn't have completed my apprenticeship program. The Department of Labor is right to keep IRAPs out of construction. Construction apprentices are more likely to complete a registered program, with its good wages and high-quality training, which means that there will be more well-trained construction workers.<br/><br/>In registered apprenticeship programs like the one I went through, we got the best training in the construction industry. In the classroom and on-the-job, we got years of state-of-the-art construction skills training and the best safety training in the business. I worked hard to obtain journey-level status, but it was worth it. I literally can pick up and move anywhere in the country and use my skills to get a good job and provide for my family. Allowing training programs that don't meet the standards required of registered programs would undercut my training and effort. High quality training is so important that I am proud to say part of my hourly wage pays for training future generations of apprentices as well as for upgrade training for journey level workers. Don't change something that works. <br/><br/>My path to the middle-class will disappear if IRAPs is ever included in construction.  Permanently excluding construction will ensure that apprentices are paid well enough that they will stick with their apprenticeship program even when the work gets tough.   It will also allow fellow workers to provide a middle-class lifestyle for their families. <br/><br/>Omar Silva

At a time when prices for everything are rising and there isn’t enough energy to meet demand, we should be opening our federal waters for responsible development - not closing them for extended periods.   <br/><br/>No new lease sales over the next 5 years, as considered in the latest DOI 5-year proposal, could be a disaster for our economy as we are trying to recover from a global energy crisis, fix our supply chains, and avoid a recession. How are families supposed to keep up if the cost of just getting to work or school keeps rising? How are small businesses or large employers alike going to hire or retain workers if it’s more expensive to keep the lights on? The government needs to take serious action to increase our energy supply - and do it quickly!  <br/><br/>We have some of the largest natural gas and oil reserves in the world right off our shores, on government-owned land, so why aren’t we using them? We know how to develop this energy responsibly. So, let’s make sure that America has a secure energy supply, so we can keep our economy going without relying on imports from overseas.  <br/><br/>For all these reasons, I ask you to support American energy by rejecting a continued pause on lease sales and committing to a reliable offshore leasing schedule that includes all of the 11 proposed sales. Offshore oil and gas leasing is crucial for our economy and national security, and we can’t afford to delay any longer.

Gerald Fords Labor Department set the salary level for overtime exemption at the equivalent of about $58,000 in todays dollarshigh enough to cover more than 50 percent of full-time salaried workers. The Obama-era rule set it at $47,476high enough to cover about 34 percent of full-time salaried employees but lower than the level that it was in the 1970s. Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people. The whole point of having national standards is to ensure decent basic standards for all workers. The updated overtime standard is already linked to the lowest-wage Census region.

Protection of habitat is central to the conservation of imperiled species, and the designation of critical habitat under the ESA is one of the best tools we have to prevent extinctions.   <br/><br/>I urge you to finalize this rule rescinding this harmful regulation, and to ensure that all listed species are afforded the critical habitat protections they need to recover and thrive. I also urge you to take further administrative action to reverse all of the harmful regulations put in place by the last administration, including those from 2019.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Barbara Wishingrad<br/>1218 Castillo St  Santa Barbara, CA 93101-6256

INFO - Comment: Greetings,<br/><br/>I’m writing in support of the proposal to list monarch butterflies under the Endangered Species Act as “threatened.”<br/><br/>Monarch butterflies have incredible value as pollinators and as an iconic American species. Yet in recent years, their numbers have dwindled to dangerous lows; recent monarch numbers are the lowest they’ve been in years. Without action, we’re on a trajectory to lose monarchs to extinction in a matter of decades.<br/><br/>This proposed listing comes at a critical juncture, while we still have an opportunity to save this species from disappearing. Strong ESA protections will provide the tools to save vital habitat and enact measures to support the monarch’s life cycle. To support their recovery, we also ask that you strengthen the proposed 4(d) rule.<br/><br/>Please move forward in listing monarch butterflies as threatened under the ESA as soon as possible, and give them the strong protective regulations they need to recover.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Michael Nielsen

INFO - Comment: As a small-business operator in Florida, I'm very disappointed to learn that the FDA is considering a ban on licensed retailers selling flavored cigars to adults 21 and older. Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning flavored cigars could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since flavored cigars alone generate $4 to $5 billion in annual retail sales and make up 37% to 47% of popular price large cigars sold in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of flavored cigars could undermine my ability to operate by impacting my revenue. <br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, sales of flavored cigars could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime in many states.    Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of flavored cigars is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.  <br/>

INFO - Title: Comment from Dan Sponholz
INFO - Comment: FAA,<br/><br/>I started flying line control model airplanes with my father and two brothers in the early 1980s.  Model aviation was a hobby that we shared together as a family.  We built, designed, and flew model airplanes together.  We bonded and grew closer as a family through our shared love of model aviation.  We are all grown now with families of our own, but will often talk about our shared experiences in model aviation.  I left the hobby for an extended period of time when I enlisted in the Air Force in 1989.<br/><br/>Fast forward almost 25 years.  My teenage son, who has always been interested in airplanes and flying,  introduced me to a YouTube channel called FliteTest.  After watching a few of their inspiring and educational videos, I was convinced that I could try radio-controlled model aviation, Something that I longed to do as a child, but was financially out of reach.  We made the leap into the RC hobby.  In doing so, my son and I shared experiences much like I remember having with my father and brothers all those years ago.  We have been building, designing, flying and bonding through model aviation ever since.<br/><br/>My son has since gone on to pursue a life-long dream in commercial aviation.  He is currently a junior at the University of North Dakota, double-majoring in commercial aviation and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).  Model aviation has had a profound impact on his love and passion for aviation and flight.  I would hate to see anyone miss out on these types of opportunities to discover and explore their passions because of unfair and costly resrictions on this hobby that we have been safely enjoying for many years.<br/><br/>In addition to enjoying the model aviation hobby with my son, I have also introduced the hobby to my nephews and brother-in-law, as well as re-introduced it my brothers and father.  This hobby is a great way for families to spend time together.  I have also become good friends with many people from this country and all over the world that I may never have had the opportunity to meet had it not been for model aviation.  I would like to see that continue for many gererations to come.  Model aviation has had a very positive impact on my life.<br/><br/>The proposed remote identification rules are too restrictive for hobbyists.  I do not fly at an Academy of Model Aviation (AMA) field, although I am an AMA member and have been for over 5 years.  There are many people who fly small electric "park-flyer" sized model aircraft, with permission, on public property such as parks, soccer fields, and school football fields.  I typically fly at a site that is not an AMA club, but is primarily used for model aviation by many people.  Under the proposed rule this site could never even be considered as a FRIA because it is not controlled by a CBO (which aren't even defined yet in under current NPRM). Furthuremore, I know many others who fly on their own private property.  They too would no longer be allowed to fly unhindered by remote ID on thier own land.  Almost all of the models that I fly I build myself, many of which I have designed myself.  Under the proposed rules, I and many others like me will only ever be allowed to fly these models at a FRIA.  The FRIAs need to be able to be established outside of a CBO.  FRIAs also need to be able to be added at any time, not just during the first year of the rule becoming law.<br/><br/>Remote ID makes sense for beyond visual line of site (BVLOS) where operators would not have full situational awareness.  It does not make sense for operators flying within visual line of site (LOS).  Pilots operating within LOS and not under Part 107 should be exempt from the proposed remote identification rules.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Dan Sponholz<br/>

INFO - Comment: Dear Bureau of Land Management,<br/><br/>I am very encouraged that BLM has requested input on how concerns about climate and greenhouse gas emissions should be addressed in the agency’s oil and gas rule. Reducing the damaging climate impacts on our public lands by starting a process to align the federal oil and gas program with our national climate commitments should be top of mind for public land management.  The summer of 2023 has brought unprecedented heat waves and record-breaking high temperatures nationwide, as well as the deadliest U.S. wildfire in the last 100 years, in Maui, surpassing the deadly Camp wildfire in California in 2018. Climate-related disasters such as flooding, wildfires, and extreme storm events will only intensify in the decades ahead without aggressive action to curb greenhouse-gas emissions on our public lands.  <br/><br/>The proposed regulations would adopt a set of long-overdue fiscal reforms, and we recognize the importance of finalizing them in a timely manner. We urge BLM to give similar urgency to addressing climate in its management of public lands.  President Biden has committed to slashing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Emissions from oil and gas production on federal lands and waters account for nearly 25% of total U.S. carbon emissions, so limiting fossil-fuel extraction on federal lands can make a significant contribution to meeting U.S. commitments. Such action will reduce the damaging effects of climate change on public lands and vulnerable populations living on or near those lands. BLM should move aggressively to protect public lands and communities by adopting regulations that require climate protection to be part of all leasing and permitting decisions, and align its oil and gas program with national and global climate commitments. Tying leasing decisions to this pledge could help prevent future approval of megaprojects such as ConocoPhillip's Willow project in Alaska. <br/><br/>We are currently living with the consequences of fossil-first policies. The time to change course is now.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Frances Melott<br/>4305 Southwind Dr  Raleigh, NC 27613-3141

INFO - Comment: Dear Commissioner Robert Califf,<br/><br/>I am writing in support of the petition by Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) requesting that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prevent manufacturers from intentionally adding sesame and other major allergens to products when they identify allergen cross-contact risks, by declaring that this practice violates food safety rules.   <br/><br/>This action is urgently needed to prevent concerning practices that have emerged as industry moves to implement the Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research (FASTER) Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2023. <br/><br/>I am concerned that with the implementation of the FASTER Act, many food manufacturers are intentionally adding sesame to products instead of implementing controls to prevent cross-contact risks. This addition of allergens has the potential to increase risks for sesame-allergic consumers, the very opposite of what the FASTER Act intended.   <br/><br/>I am also concerned that this practice has the potential to undermine long-established protections for Americans with food allergies, so I’m urging the FDA to take action before it spreads. If food manufacturers can evade food safety requirements simply by adding and then declaring trace amounts of allergens, there will be a strong economic incentive to apply this practice more generally to all major food allergens, increasing risks and decreasing safe food access. This would not only affect the estimated 1.5 million Americans with sesame allergies but would affect nearly 34 million Americans estimated to have any type of food allergy. <br/><br/>Please act swiftly to grant CSPI’s petition and put an end to this dangerous practice.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Robbin Katzin<br/>Chicago, IL

INFO - Comment: Holtec and its subsidiaries are not qualified to hold the licenses of the Indian Point Energy Center.  Given its record, area residents have no confidence in Holtec and do not accept it as the licensee. The Commission must not approve the license transfer, for the same reasons.  Holtec has multiple problems, any one of which ought to disqualify it from decommissioning Indian Point. Taken together, they add up to a clear imperative to reject Holtec as the licensee.<br/>Holtec lacks the experience needed to decommission Indian Point safely. Its entire nuclear "fleet" was acquired less than a year ago.   It has never decommissioned a nuclear plant before; its first decommissioning job is Oyster Creek, which it acquired in July 2019. It is in effect learning on the job. The bulk of its experience is in spent fuel handling, where its performance has been poor.<br/>Holtec and its subsidiaries are privately held and their finances are opaque. Their business model is based on maximally leveraging the decommissioning trust fund and taxpayer moneys for their profit. But they haven't demonstrated sufficient capitalization to complete decommissioning, especially if decommissioning costs exceed their unreliably low estimates.<br/>As New York Attorney General Letitia James said when she filed a petition to challenge license transfer to Holtec, "Putting the decommissioning of Indian Point in the hands of a company with no experience and uncertain financial resources is very risky."  Many elected officials in New York support the AG's filing and share her objections to Holtec.

INFO - Title: Comment from Desiree Nagyfy
INFO - Comment: The leak detection and repair proposal from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration will improve safety in our communities, reduce economic losses from leaked gas, and protect our planet by reducing methane emissions that contribute to the climate crisis. PHMSA must act quickly to finalize comprehensive standards for gas pipelines.<br/><br/>Important elements of this proposal include requiring more frequent leak surveys, faster leak repair times, use of more advanced technologies and equipment for detecting leaks, minimizing intentional venting and blowdowns and increasing the quality and availability of data available to the public.<br/><br/>PHMSA should improve the proposal in the following ways. First, operators should be required to find and fix leaks on all gas-gathering pipelines. Right now, there are hundreds of thousands of gathering pipelines that are not subject to minimum maintenance requirements, presenting an environmental and safety risk. The proposal would address some but not all of these pipelines  PHMSA should close this gap and require operators to manage leaks on all gathering lines. <br/><br/>Second, PHMSA should set clear and rigorous definitions for leak detection technology performance, to ensure that operators have clarity regarding which equipment satisfies the advanced methane detection standard that will maximize leak identification. The proposal provides broad discretion to operators in implementing leak detection and repair programs, which could result in confusion and suboptimal outcomes. <br/><br/>Third, PHMSA should adopt clear and strong well integrity standards that include standards for infrastructure and monitoring to prevent leaks as well as leak detection and repair standards for the nations 400 underground natural gas storage facilities and associated pipeline infrastructure.<br/><br/>Finally, I ask that PHMSA not provide an exemption for soon-to-be-replaced pipes. Older pipes are known for leaking more, but the proposal would allow operators to ignore identified gas leaks for as long as five years if the pipe segment is scheduled for replacement. To ensure safety and reduce harmful methane emissions, operators should be required to address known leaks even if the pipeline will eventually be replaced.   <br/><br/>Another piece that could be improved is expanding information reported by pipeline operators. With more data and transparency, we can better mitigate the harm by current pipelines and we can set out a better plan for future actions.<br/><br/>We should seize this opportunity to support cost-effective and common-sense standards that protect both our communities and our climate. This proposal is strong, but I know we can make it stronger to set our country up for success in the years to come.

INFO - Title: Comment from Litman, Laurie
INFO - Comment: I urge the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries to rescind in full the 2019 Trump-era regulations that severely weakened protections for our nation’s most imperiled animals and plants. These changes represented the most significant rollbacks to the Endangered Species Act in the law’s 50-year history and pushed hundreds of species closer to the brink of extinction.  <br/> <br/>It is extremely disappointing that this proposed rule retains a number of harmful provisions governing the responsibility of federal agencies to avoid jeopardizing protected species or adversely modifying their critical habitat. In particular, it retains a definition of “adverse modification” that requires federal actions to affect species’ critical habitat “as a whole” before real habitat protections are put in place. This is especially harmful for species like the northern spotted owl, polar bear or gulf sturgeon that have large critical habitat designations but are still at risk of extinction. The provision ignores the basic fact that the single largest driver of extinction here and around the world is habitat loss and allows the Services to turn a blind eye to the vast majority of actions that harm critical habitat.  <br/> <br/>The proposed rule also retains the Trump-era definition of “environmental baseline,” which lets federal agencies off the hook for past harms to endangered species from things like dam or highway construction by deeming these projects part of the baseline. It absolves the agencies of much responsibility for the damage caused by interrelated actions they facilitate, such as urban growth from highway expansion or increased global warming from emissions related to federal oil and gas leasing.  <br/> <br/>The remaining Trump-era regulations that the agencies are proposing to retain — including the criteria for not prudent determinations for critical habitat — are equally problematic and will continue to put endangered species at greater risk of extinction. Thus, I urge the Services to rescind them in their entirety without exception. <br/> <br/>There are some aspects of the proposed rule that I support. I am grateful that the Biden administration plans to restore the “blanket 4(d) rule,” which will restore protections for threatened species. I also support reinserting the provision that prohibits consideration of economic impacts when deciding to protect species, as well as the provision that removes barriers to designate critical habitat for climate-impacted species.  <br/><br/>However, while the proposed rule restores some pieces of the Endangered Species Act regulations, it is wholly inadequate and represents a huge missed opportunity to make meaningful progress to recover our most vulnerable animals and plants on the 50th anniversary of the Act’s passage.  <br/> <br/>With time running out, we can’t afford more of the status quo. Combating the global wildlife extinction crisis will require the Services to be bolder and more visionary than any other administration in history. For these reasons, I urge the Services to not only rescind the Trump-era rollbacks in their entirety, but to also strengthen the implementation of the Endangered Species Act to avert the extinction crisis and curtail the ongoing loss of biodiversity in the United States and around the world.

INFO - Comment: As a clinician, I urge CMS to ensure the final Physician Fee Schedule for 2023 strengthens access to psychological services and meets the mental health needs of diverse and underserved communities. Many of the issues raised in this year's Physician Fee Schedule have serious implications for equity in access to behavioral health care. Through my comments, I also urge CMS to work with the American Psychological Association to develop new rate-setting methodologies to better reflect the cost of furnishing services and ensure Medicare beneficiaries have access to needed mental and behavioral health services.<br/><br/>Strengthen the Practice of Psychology<br/>BHI Codes <br/>I support CMS' proposed coding and payment for General Behavioral Health Integration (BHI) to recognize psychologists' role in integrated care. I appreciate CMS' support for multiple evidence-based models of integrated care, as it allows psychologists the flexibility required to support the behavioral health needs of the broader community.<br/><br/>Medicare Potentially Underutilized Services<br/>I appreciate CMS' request for comments on potentially underutilized services, as several of the services CMS identified are performed by psychologists. I recommend CMS create additional Cognitive Assessment & Care codes without the medication reconciliation service because medication management is outside the scope of a psychologist's license in many states. Additionally, I recommend CMS allow reimbursement for Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Obesity services provided by psychologists. <br/><br/>Chronic Pain Management and Treatment (CPM) Bundles<br/>I ask CMS to create additional bundled pain management codes that do not include medication management. I am concerned that psychologists would be excluded from this new bundled service because in most states medication management is outside the scope of a psychologist's license. Psychologists play a critical role in implementing non-pharmacological approaches to treatment, which may be safer or more effective for some patients, as well as team-based comprehensive pain management.<br/><br/>Telehealth<br/>Many patients in rural and underserved areas are now able to access mental health services, often for the first time. Additionally, many patients prefer utilizing telehealth for a variety of reasons. Reverting to the non-facility rate for telehealth services after the end of the COVID public health emergency will lead practitioners to offer telehealth less frequently or to restrict the number of Medicare beneficiaries they treat using telehealth.<br/><br/>Expand Psychology Training and Workforce Development<br/>Supervision by Psychologists <br/>I applaud CMS' Proposed Revisions to the "Incident to" Physicians' Services Regulation for Behavioral Health Services to allow for reimbursement for Physicians and Non-Physician Providers (NPPs), which include psychologists, who supervise these practitioners in their everyday practice. This will help expand access to and coordination of mental health services in rural and underserved areas where masters'-level practitioners represent a substantial segment of the mental health providers in the area.<br/><br/>Advanced Psychology Trainee Services <br/>I urge CMS to allow for Medicare reimbursement of services provided by advanced psychology trainees under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. Although psychology interns receive extensive clinical experience prior to their internship, services provided by trainees under the supervision of a licensed psychologist are not reimbursable under Medicare. Without Medicare reimbursement of services provided by trainees, training programs lack a steady source of funding. <br/><br/>Support the Psychological Research-to-Practice Pipeline<br/>Caregiving Behavior Management Training<br/>I ask CMS to reconsider its position on the caregiver behavior management training codes. There is extensive empirical support for caregiver behavior management training and it is the gold standard treatment approach for several health behavior issues. Although the patient is not present when this training is provided, these codes have many benefits for the patient, including a reduction in disruptive and problematic behaviors for children with ADHD, improved weight management for individuals with obesity, and better management of patients with dementia.<br/><br/>Digital Therapeutics<br/>I urge CMS to accept APA's proposal that would establish a new set of reimbursement codes for digital therapeutics-one for purchase of the device, one for patient education about the device, and two for ongoing management of the service furnished through the device.  Unlike the RTM codes, this structure reimburses for an active therapeutic intervention, as opposed to passively monitoring a patient's condition. A new set of reimbursement codes as outlined above will have a positive impact on access to treatment amongst patients who have limited access to traditional office-based treatment or who prefer the use of digital devices over a face-to-face visit.

INFO - Comment: To Whom It May Concern: <br/><br/>While I appreciate that the Department of the Interior finally released a proposed 5-year offshore leasing program after a long delay, I am concerned the program falls far short of what is needed to meet our country’s energy needs. I’m particularly concerned that the new program leaves open the possibility that there will be no new oil and natural gas lease sales over the next five years, during a time in which energy prices are rising, global supply chains are being disrupted, and inflation remains at historic levels. <br/><br/>This is a serious economic risk for millions of American families. It's much harder to have affordable energy if we restrict access to  the vast resources we have here at home. Unfortunately, that’s what’s happened with the recent cancellation of new lease sales and could continue if the no lease sale option is chosen in the Department’s Final Program.  <br/><br/>It’s also a jobs issue. Offshore leasing accounts for 325,000 jobs in the Gulf of Mexico, contributing billions to the economy and local, state, and federal tax revenues. Are you really willing to risk these tremendous benefits and instead rely more on foreign sources of energy to meet our domestic needs? I certainly hope not. <br/><br/>I am encouraging the Department to quickly finalize its 5-year Program and move forward with the option that allows for the maximum number of lease sales during that time frame. These sales will help the United States continue its energy leadership, support good-paying jobs, and meet domestic energy demand with resources produced right here. <br/><br/>Thank you, and I look forward to the Department quickly finalizing a robust five-year program for offshore natural gas and oil leasing. We cannot afford to wait any longer. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/>William Angelini

INFO - Comment: Dear Joseph Bayer,<br/><br/>I urge you to finalize federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for model years 2027-2032 at least as strong as the alternative providing a three percent increase per year for passenger cars and a five percent increase per year for light trucks, referred to as PC3LT5.<br/><br/>As gas prices continue to be unpredictable, with increases that are often straining household budgets, strong fuel economy standards are needed more than ever! CAFE standards are a simple and efficient pathway to true energy security, protecting drivers from gas price fluctuations by dramatically reducing oil demand. Strong standards will not only help protect American drivers from volatile gas prices, but will also prompt the auto industry to deliver more efficient vehicles.<br/><br/>CAFE standards incentivize manufacturers to invest in and apply technologies that improve overall vehicle fuel efficiency, saving consumers money at the pump. Industry innovation spurred by strong fuel economy standards has also prompted technology advancements that have made the current fleet of new cars and trucks in the United States the safest, cleanest, most fuel-efficient vehicles produced in our country which is good for the first owners of the vehicle and continues to offer savings into the future for drivers who buy used cars.<br/><br/>It's vital that we pass strong fuel economy standards. Compared to NHTSA's preferred alternative, the next most stringent standard (PC3LT5) would cut gasoline use and heat trapping emissions 27 percent more from vehicles sold through the 2032 model year. This translates to at least $12 billion back in the hands of consumers.<br/><br/>Strong fuel economy standards have support from the public and are critical tools in our toolbox to support household budgets and support the planet.  Again, I urge you to adopt the CAFE standards for model years 2027-2032—at least as strong as the PC3LT5.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mrs. Glory Arroyos<br/>Austin, TX 78704

INFO - Comment: I strongly oppose the proposed rule on the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) that changes the definition of "take" and exempts incidental takes from law's prohibitions.<br/><br/>This change reverses long-standing policy and much-needed protections, incentivizing businesses, industry and individuals to cut corners on safety and avoid being held accountable for bird deaths caused by their negligence, greed or indifference.<br/><br/>A National Audubon Society study found that two-thirds of North America's birds are threatened by climate change. And a study published in Science reports that we've lost 3 billion birds on this continent since 1970 29% of the total bird population. Our bird population is already on the ropes. This change could trigger a mass-extinction event. <br/><br/>And if bird populations collapse, it will have a ripple effect on other populations worldwide. Birds are key to insect control, among other things.<br/><br/>Examples of massive "incidental" bird losses aren't difficult to find:<br/><br/>"The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill is perhaps the most prominent example of a company's mistake severely damaging an ecosystem in Alaska. On March 24 of that year, a tanker hit a reef, tearing the hull and pouring 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. That spill killed an estimated 250,000 birds. Exxon was found to be in violation of several environmental laws following the spill, including the Migratory Bird Act...." https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/03/10/under-proposed-trump-changes-to-migratory-bird-act-exxon-wouldnt-have-been-fined-for-valdez-spill-advocacy-groups-say/<br/><br/>From the Audubon Society recalling BP's Deepwater Horizon oil disaster: "Over the course of 87 days, 130 million gallons of oil were dumped into the Gulf of Mexico killing a million birds and other marine life. To date, as a result of the MBTA, over $64 million of BP settlement funds have been paid out.... These funds have protected or restored more than 350,000 acres benefitting birds and people." https://www.audubon.org/news/audubon-remembers-deepwater-horizon-accountability-matters<br/><br/>Moreover, from 500,000 to 1 million birds have died in oil pits alone (as of 2017). https://www.fws.gov/birds/bird-enthusiasts/threats-to-birds.php<br/><br/>With the issuance of this new rule, we can expect these mortality figures to skyrocket.<br/><br/>Far from being heavy handed, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has used a balanced approach to reduce preventable bird deaths through the sensible enforcement of the existing MBTA, using the broad intent of the law and treaties to conserve the country's native migratory birds from a variety of threats.<br/><br/>Under FWS leadership, the federal government has successfully worked with industries, state agencies, and NGOs. And the MBTA has provided the incentive to adopt common-sense practices that save bird's lives, such as covering oil waste pits or retrofitting transmission lines. The MBTA also has provided accountability and helped to fund recovery efforts after events that kill substantial numbers of birds, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. <br/><br/>If this proposed rule, like the Solicitor's Opinion before it, is approved, why businesses or industries adopt these common-sense safety practices? Where would we obtain funding for environmental cleanups and restoration after major industrial accidents?<br/><br/>In summary, I strongly oppose the huge loophole that this proposed rule would create. And I decry the rushed public process that does not permit a full and thoughtful analysis of the significant environmental damage it will cause. I ask you you defer a final rule and delay the codification of the flawed and detrimental Solicitor's Opinion (M-37050).<br/><br/>If the federal government lacks the time to gather information on the financial impact of this rule  as indicated in its regulatory impact analysis of the MBTAand offers no companion environmental impact analysis, then an informed decision cannot be possible. It would be absurd to approve this rule without in-depth, comprehensive analysis of the financial and environment impacts.<br/><br/>Thank you.

INFO - Comment: Dear Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms,<br/><br/>I am writing in support of the ATF's proposed rule (Docket No ATF 2022R-17), which would dramatically reduce the number of guns sold without a background check.<br/><br/>Our background check system was created to keep firearms out of the hands of individuals who are not allowed to purchase or possess them in the first place. But loopholes in the system—like the ones that allow unlicensed gun sellers to sell guns online and at gun shows without running background checks on their buyers—undermine it.<br/><br/>That’s why ATF’s proposed rule is so important and should be finalized. It will help close loopholes in our background check system that have, for decades, been exploited by bad actors like gun traffickers, straw purchasers, and other prohibited persons, including domestic abusers and convicted felons.<br/><br/>I support the proposed rule because it makes clear that firearms dealing can take place wherever and through whatever medium guns are bought and sold—whether that’s at a gun show or an online marketplace—and that certain conduct, like selling guns of the same or similar kind and type, constitutes firearms dealing. That means that these gun sellers will need to become licensed dealers and, as licensed dealers, run background checks.<br/><br/>The proposed rule won't just expand background checks and strengthen our background check system, but it will also save lives. That’s why I support the proposed rule and why I encourage ATF to finalize it.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Janine Krogh

Right now, with energy prices extremely high, reducing domestic production is counter intuitive. I hope you will take a step forward with the proposal to open federal  waters to environmentally responsible development.  <br/><br/>Without any new lease sales over the next five years, American producers will be put at a disadvantage on the global economic stage, putting our economy and our national security at risk. Why should we strangle domestic natural gas and oil production when there is an abundance of resources in the Gulf of Mexico? It doesn’t make sense.  <br/><br/>Republican and Democratic administrations alike have recognized the strategic advantages of U.S. offshore domestic energy production. Now President Biden and the Department of the Interior must step up to the plate and do what is right for America’s energy needs. Fossil fuels will remain an important part of our energy mix; controlling our own energy future means developing the resources we have here at home. <br/><br/>Please support American energy and move forward with a commonsense offshore leasing schedule that will empower our economy and strengthen our national security. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/>Anna Bottorff

INFO - Title: Comment from Dene Canon
INFO - Comment: The leak detection and repair proposal from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration will improve safety in our communities, reduce economic losses from leaked gas, and protect our planet by reducing methane emissions that contribute to the climate crisis. PHMSA must act quickly to finalize comprehensive standards for gas pipelines.<br/><br/>Important elements of this proposal include requiring more frequent leak surveys, faster leak repair times, use of more advanced technologies and equipment for detecting leaks, minimizing intentional venting and blowdowns and increasing the quality and availability of data available to the public.<br/><br/>PHMSA should improve the proposal in the following ways. First, operators should be required to find and fix leaks on all gas-gathering pipelines. Right now, there are hundreds of thousands of gathering pipelines that are not subject to minimum maintenance requirements, presenting an environmental and safety risk. The proposal would address some but not all of these pipelines  PHMSA should close this gap and require operators to manage leaks on all gathering lines. <br/><br/>Second, PHMSA should set clear and rigorous definitions for leak detection technology performance, to ensure that operators have clarity regarding which equipment satisfies the advanced methane detection standard that will maximize leak identification. The proposal provides broad discretion to operators in implementing leak detection and repair programs, which could result in confusion and suboptimal outcomes. <br/><br/>Third, PHMSA should adopt clear and strong well integrity standards that include standards for infrastructure and monitoring to prevent leaks as well as leak detection and repair standards for the nations 400 underground natural gas storage facilities and associated pipeline infrastructure.<br/><br/>Finally, I ask that PHMSA not provide an exemption for soon-to-be-replaced pipes. Older pipes are known for leaking more, but the proposal would allow operators to ignore identified gas leaks for as long as five years if the pipe segment is scheduled for replacement. To ensure safety and reduce harmful methane emissions, operators should be required to address known leaks even if the pipeline will eventually be replaced.   <br/><br/>Another piece that could be improved is expanding information reported by pipeline operators. With more data and transparency, we can better mitigate the harm by current pipelines and we can set out a better plan for future actions.<br/><br/>We should seize this opportunity to support cost-effective and common-sense standards that protect both our communities and our climate. This proposal is strong, but I know we can make it stronger to set our country up for success in the years to come.

This imbalance is grossly incompatible with current U.S. climate and conservation goals. The prioritization of resource extraction is actively contributing to the climate crisis; use of lands for unregulated motorized recreation is destroying critical wildlife habitat and damaging important Indigenous cultural sites. <br/><br/>The agency must rebalance its management of public lands. By shifting the agency’s focus to prioritize conservation, BLM can take bold action to protect imperiled wildlife, preserve vanishing cultural sites and protect vital natural resources like carbon sinks and water supplies in the era of climate change. In fact, recent polling found that 82 percent of voters in the West support the goal of conserving 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030, and four-in-five say loss of open natural areas is a problem. <br/><br/>During the White House Conservation in Action Summit, President Biden reflected that our conservation work is critical for providing a bridge to our past and future.

Flooding the ocean with industrial noise for years will harm marine animals throughout the Gulf, as well as vital habitat for the critically endangered Gulf of Mexico whale. With no more than 50 of them left, we should be doing all we can to protect them from the harmful impacts of seismic testing instead of risking their survival in the search for more fossil fuels the world can’t afford to burn..   <br/><br/>Seismic blasts can exceed 235 decibels – louder than a rocket launch and hundreds of times louder than the noise level that would cause pain in the human ear – and could inflict permanent, and even fatal hearing damage on these creatures. Whales and dolphins rely heavily on sound to communicate, navigate, and find prey. Seismic airguns can deafen whales at close proximities and even at a distance, they can disrupt the animals’ behavior hundreds of thousands of times and could drive them away from vital habitats.  <br/><br/>These seismic blasts will harm marine mammals in the Gulf for the sake of oil and gas reserves that we don’t need. The oil industry has a store of nearly 8 million acres of public land in the Gulf that has yet to be developed. Our future lies in a rapid transition to a clean economy, not in exploiting more dirty oil from under the bottom of the sea.

INFO - Comment: To the EPA:<br/><br/>Please take the following comment seriously.  Our futures depend upon it, and pollinators are under attack from too many sources, and they continue to seriously decline.  This jeopardizes our food supply as we know it, and the results of not just continuing the current allowable levels of neonics but of increasing them would be absolutely disastrous.  <br/><br/>The agency must reject the proposed tolerance increases for the use of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam. The registrant, Syngenta, claims that the use of foliar applications will be more likely to stick to the leaves of crops, and thus are less risky to pollinators; but the fact remains that these chemicals are systemic and persistent, and any amount applied will contaminate soil. It also has the potential to be expressed in the crops pollen, nectar, and guttation (dew) droplets on which pollinators forage and drink.<br/><br/>Rather than increase the use of this pesticide in our environment, I urge the agency to work with stakeholders to eliminate its use.<br/><br/>During Pollinator Week 2014, the White House issued a Presidential Memorandum directing agencies to reverse pollinator losses and help restore populations to healthy levels. Certainly, an increase in the tolerance level for a neonicotinoid implicated by researchers across the globe in causing these pollinator losses would be a step backwards for pollinator health, and not in line with the Presidents call.<br/><br/>We can move agriculture in a sustainable direction that is safe for pollinators, and eliminate the use of thiamethoxam and other neonicotinoid insecticides, but it requires leadership from EPA to do so. Rejecting Syngenta's request would signal that the agency is taking pollinator losses seriously. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.  I will be watching this decision closely and hoping that the EPA can come out in support of the environment and the future of our food as it is supposed to do.  <br/><br/>Steve Schneider<br/>180 Woodedge Drive<br/>Bloomfield Hills, MI 48304<br/>steveschneider123@gmail.com

We have one of the highest rates of diabetes in the nation.<br/><br/>Diabetes Self-Management Training (DSMT) has been a covered benefit under Medicare Part B for beneficiaries with diabetes for over 15 years. DSMT is critically important to help people effectively self-manage their diabetes and avoid costly and devastating complications of the disease. <br/><br/>In the proposed rule (file code CMS-1654-P), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recognizes the extremely low utilization of the DSMT benefit and asks for public comments on barriers to accessing the DSMT benefit.<br/><br/>Barriers to access include: <br/><br/>-The 10 hours of DSMT available in the initial year are lost if not used and only 2 hours of DSMT are allowed each subsequent yearthese limits restrict access to needed education. <br/>Recommendation: Extend the availability of the initial 10 hours beyond the first year until fully used and cover additional hours of DSMT for beneficiaries based on individual need. <br/><br/>-Individual (one-on-one) DSMT is available only in limited circumstances; usually beneficiaries must receive DSMT in a group setting, but group DSMT may not be easily available or the best patient-centered care choice. <br/>Recommendation: Eliminate the restrictions on who is eligible for individual DSMT and the requirement that the ordering provider must document a need for individual DSMT in the medical record and referral. <br/><br/>-CMS' planned clarification that Hospital Outpatient Department DSMT services must be furnished in the hospital and cannot be furnished at alternate non-hospital locations prevents numerous accredited DSMT programs from expanding to community locations and reaching more beneficiaries with diabetes.<br/>Recommendation: Allow Hospital Outpatient Department DSMT programs to expand their accredited DSMT program to community locations, including alternate non-hospital locations. <br/><br/>-DSMT and Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) cannot be provided on the same day resulting in failure to provide necessary disease management education even when it is urgently needed and accessible. <br/>Recommendation: Allow DSMT and MNT to be provided on the same day for those who qualify for the services. <br/><br/>-Restrictions on which providers can refer beneficiaries to DSMT results in missed opportunities for this important service. <br/>Recommendation: Broaden which providers can refer beneficiaries with diabetes to DSMT beyond the provider managing the individuals' diabetic condition to include other physicians and non-physician providers caring for the patient with diabetes, such as hospitalists, emergency room providers, and specialists. <br/><br/>-Patients are subject to the Part B deductible and 20% cost sharing for DSMT. <br/>Recommendation: Remove beneficiary cost sharing for DSMT to improve access.<br/>

INFO - Comment: As a supporter of protecting our nations wildlife, I strongly oppose the Trump administrations proposed changes to weaken wildlife protections. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is our nations most effective law for protecting wildlife in danger of extinction, but the proposed changes to key regulations implementing the ESA would significantly weaken efforts to protect imperiled species and undermine the successes of the ESA in protecting species from extinction.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The ESA has had success in preventing 99 percent of listed species from extinction and leading many species towards recovery. But these proposals would weaken the role of science-based listings, prevent threatened species from receiving the protections they need, and severely limit habitat protections.<br/><br/>I strongly urge you to withdraw the three proposals (FWS-HQ-ES-2018-0006, FWS-HQ-ES-2018-0007, and FWS-HQ-ES-2018-0009) to dramatically roll back ESA safeguards.

INFO - Comment: Thank you for proposing this new regulation on implementing the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA is a crucial tool that protects vulnerable plants and animals, including those found in our national parks. <br/><br/>National parks provide habitat for around 600 threatened and endangered species, from grizzly bears in Glacier National Park to the loggerhead sea turtle in Everglades National Park to the spruce-fir moss spider in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Seeing wildlife is one of the top reasons Americans visit national parks.<br/><br/>These regulations eliminate some of the harmful rules put in place during the previous administration and are an important step forward in protecting our national parks from the ongoing biodiversity crisis. However, there is more work to do. The consultation requirements under the ESA must be strong, and the federal government should not engage in activities that could jeopardize species' survival or destroy the habitat they need to survive and recover. This draft regulation does not meet the mark.<br/><br/>Our most vulnerable species cant afford to wait. Please make sure our ESA protections are as strong as possible.

INFO - Comment: The American people do not want our fragile coastal watersfrom the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic to the Pacific -- opened to dangerous oil and gas drilling. Drilling in these waters poses grave risks to coastal residents and their livelihoods, jeopardizes critical ecosystems, and increases the threat of devastating oil spills, all while driving climate-wrecking carbon pollution and threatening our clean energy future. <br/><br/>Less than a year ago, the federal government finished an exhaustive examination of offshore drilling and concluded that expanding drilling into these unspoiled regions was not supported by the public or the science. This has not changed.  <br/><br/>I am appalled that the Trump Administration would waste federal resources and ignore the public by restarting this process. Intensifying coastal drilling is out of step with our nations transition to clean energy. Its nothing more than another handout to private oil companies, forcing taxpayers to continue subsidizing the fossil fuel industry when the majority of Americans have made clear that they want to protect these public resources. <br/><br/>The public has spoken, and the science is clear. Please stand with the American people, not Big Polluters, and stop reckless oil and gas drilling off our shores. <br/>

INFO - Comment: Regulations, and particularly EPA regulations, are necessary for the most obvious of reasons. We live in a capitalist society, where the quest for profit trumps all other considerations and competition is often cut throat between businesses providing the same or similar goods and/or services. This means that if regulations are rolled back for the sake of more profits, the government fails to ensure that all businesses operate in a level playing field and at the same time fails to protect the health and safety of workers, that of the consumers and of all who live in this planet. Regulations do this by requiring the production of goods and services that are safe to use and manufactured in a way that does not do damage to the environment, while also providing a decent living wage and a safe work environment to its workers. The need for a vigilant and vibrant oversight body such as the EPA protects us all and keeps those that would try to gain an unfair advantage by failing to provide the above-mentioned safeguards in check, its absence would result in an eventual elimination of those that would voluntarily abide by safe and environmentally and worker friendly practices by undercutting their prices. The EPA as well as other regulatory agencies are vital for the main function of government, which is to provide for the general welfare and secure the inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To weaken them is no less than to betray your mission as paladins of the common good and worthy representatives of all of the people.

INFO - Comment: Alexander Acosta,<br/><br/>Back in 1975, President Gerald Fords Labor Department set the salary level for overtime exemption at the equivalent of about $58,000 in todays dollarshigh enough to cover more than 50 percent of full-time salaried workers. The Obama-era rule set it at $47,476high enough to cover about 34 percent of full-time salaried employees but lower than the level that it was in the 1970s. Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people. The whole point of having national standards is to ensure decent basic standards for all workers. The updated overtime standard is already linked to the lowest-wage Census region. Workers rights and wages should not be undercut even further by weakening the salary threshold.<br/><br/>Sarah Baethge<br/>sarah.baethge@gmail.com<br/>2602 S. 39th ST<br/>Temple, Texas 76504

Food and Drug Administration <br/><br/>RE: Docket No. FDA-2015-N-0030 <br/><br/>Dear FDA, <br/><br/>I am writing as a patient who has relied on compounded GLP-1 medications to effectively manage my health during the ongoing shortage of brand-name products from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. The recent requests by both companies to restrict compounding of GLP-1 drugs is deeply concerning. It fails to recognize how crucial these options have become for patients like me, especially given that the drugmakers have been and continue to be unable to meet demand for their drugs. <br/><br/>Compounded GLP-1s have provided an accessible alternative for many of us who have been unable to obtain the brand-name products. Contrary to claims that the compounding process is too complex, pharmacists have confirmed that these preparations can be compounded under sterile conditions with just five ingredients in a short time. State-licensed compounding pharmacies adhere to rigorous compliance standards to ensure sterility and quality, making legitimate compounded products a reliable choice for patients like me at a time when the supply chain for the branded drugs is unreliable. <br/><br/>The drugmakers’ assertion that compounded versions are unsafe appears to be misleading. Judging by reports to FDA’s adverse events reporting database, the adverse events reported for compounded versions of the drugs are quite similar to those reported for the branded versions. <br/><br/>If patient safety is truly the drugmakers’ priority, then limiting viable alternatives during a shortage only further restricts my ability to manage my health. I’m told pharmacies cannot refer to compounded drugs as safe and effective, but for me, that’s exactly what my compounded GLP-1 has been. <br/><br/>Please keep compounded GLP-1s available for patients. For many of us, this is not just an alternative but an essential part of our care while Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk work to meet demand for their products. Restricting access to compounded versions would unnecessarily disrupt treatment for those of us who have come to rely on it. <br/><br/>Thank you for considering the needs of patients like me who depend on accessible treatment options to manage our health effectively.

The Trump Administration’s attempt to shrink the poverty line by changing how it is adjusted for inflation is cruel and irresponsible. Changing the poverty line would mean millions of people could be denied help with essential medical treatment, prescription drugs, food, and home heating or cooling assistance, or see reductions in that help. Low-income people see their costs go up more than most people, so shrinking the poverty line will simply define them as nonpoor and deny them the help they badly need. The Trump Administration should make a good-faith effort to find accurate measures of poverty and to understand the impact of the changes they propose on children, working people, retirees, women, people with disabilities, and communities of color instead of trying to redefine poverty out of existence. <br/><br/>Nancy Harrison <br/>nanorliz@gmail.com <br/>340 Riviera Drive <br/>Crescent City, Florida 32112<br/><br/> <br/>

INFO - Comment: Restore the Roadless Rule for the Tongass National Forest, Docket #FS-2021-0007-0006    Dear Secretary Tom Vilsack,    I strongly support restoring full Roadless Rule protection to the Tongass National Forest.    The Tongass is America's wildest national forest, with more than 9 million acres of roadless areas. It provides habitat for a wide range of wildlife, including Alexander Archipelago wolves, grizzly bears and salmon. And it's the ancestral homelands of the Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian peoples.    The Tongass stores a vast amount of carbon, with its centuries-old trees serving as a carbon-reserve life raft in this time of climate change. Logging would release most of that carbon into the atmosphere.    Closing the door to clearcutting and bulldozing roads will protect the forest's many values. The Tongass belongs to everyone and shouldn't be sacrificed to the timber industry, which provides a small fraction of the jobs and income in Southeast Alaska compared to tourism and fishing - both of which rely on intact forests to thrive.    Further, I urge you to swiftly implement your "Southeast Alaska Sustainability Strategy" announced last year, which for the Tongass would end large-scale old-growth timber sales on roadless and roaded lands, focusing forest management on restoring lands degraded by logging and roads, as well as on recreation, climate health, wildlife habit, and watershed improvement.    For wildlands, wildlife, people and our future, the Service should restore full Roadless Rule protection to the Tongass and end commercial old-growth and mature forest logging there.    Thank you for this opportunity to comment.    Sincerely,    Dessaline Moore    -PII-

Relocation within the region is not favorable due to excessive poaching, loss of habitat, and significant drought conditions.  If not relocated, these magnificent creatures will be culled. Each partner zoo has the resources to provide the elephants with wonderful new homes, proper nutrition and excellent veterinary care.  In addition, the ongoing support for Swazilands in-situ rhino conservation program by the partner zoos will contribute to the survival of the rhinos.

It will reduce delays and uncertainties and lower the overall risk for companies - resulting in greater transparency and predictability for local governments and small businesses.<br/><br/>The list of stakeholders who would benefit is long. They include but are not limited to: state and local governments, infrastructure workers and the building trades, agriculture, clean energy, forestry, manufacturing, transportation, and small businesses.<br/><br/>The benefits of reforming NEPA are incalculable and we must act now. I strongly support the Council on Environmental Quality's proposed reforms.<br/><br/>Regards, <br/>Kamaree Dukes<br/>Opal ridge pl<br/>Tampa, FL, 33659 <br/>

However, a Congressional Research Service report recently put out a more accurate estimate that there could be as many as 40,000,000 pistol braces and pistol-braced firearms in common use. <br/> <br/>There are so many braces in circulation because ATF has been issuing interpretive guidance approval letters for such firearm accessories for nearly a decade.  <br/> <br/>ATF cannot reverse its interpretive guidance-banning millions of commonly owned and legally acquired firearms while simultaneously criminalizing millions of Americans overnight-on the whims of a politician following through on campaign promises without the consent or cooperation of the Congress. <br/> <br/>Further, in Gun Owners of America v. Garland, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals noted, "[n]otwithstanding the ATF's frequent reversals on major policy issues," "[f]ederal criminal laws are not administrative edicts handed down upon the masses as if the administrators were God delivering the Ten Commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai." <br/> <br/>This proposed rule change is unacceptable, a violation of the statutes at hand, and a violation of my Second Amendment rights! It must be withdrawn immediately.

INFO - Comment: Dear Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, <br/><br/>As a consumer of alcoholic beverages, I do not believe current alcohol labels provide adequate information. Please act swiftly to propose rules to require on-package labeling of nutrition facts, ingredients, allergens, alcohol content, and serving size, plus servings and standard drinks per container. <br/><br/>Consumers need more information on alcohol labels to make informed purchasing and consumption decisions:  <br/><br/>-For the 33 million Americans with food allergies, knowing what is in a product from ingredient and allergen labeling can be a matter of life or death. <br/><br/>-Alcohol content and serving size information is additionally important to help people consume alcohol in safe amounts and prevent alcohol-related deaths. Consumers currently have no easy way of knowing how many servings of alcohol they are consuming, which may increase the risk of impaired-driving and other alcohol-related accidents. <br/><br/>-All consumers deserve to know what ingredients are in their beverages. For example, many would be surprised to know that TTB allows around 75 additives in wine and that many wines are “back-sweetened” with sugar added after fermentation. This is information people need to inform purchasing decisions. <br/><br/>-Excess calorie intake can lead to weight gain and related chronic diseases. Alcohol provides “empty calories” and accounts for, on average, about 9% of daily calorie intake for people who drink alcohol. Calorie labeling is critical to inform people about their daily calorie intake and help them avoid exceeding daily recommended limits. <br/><br/>-Nutrition information is important for anyone tracking their daily nutrient intake or trying to limit specific nutrients like carbs, fat, sugar, or sodium (all of which are present in at least some alcoholic beverages). It is especially critical for people with diabetes to know the carbohydrate content of anything they consume, including beverages. Also, FDA surveys show that 71% of consumers are trying to limit sugars and 46% are watching their sodium intake. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, most alcohol labels still leave consumers in the dark about this vital information. Alcohol producers have had the option to include voluntary “Serving Facts” labels (with alcohol content, calories, and nutrition information) since 2013, but a recent study found the voluntary label was present on only 28% of beers sampled and no wines.<br/><br/>For nutrition and alcohol content information to be accessible to all, it is vital that it be mandated to appear on each container. Consumers shouldn‘t have to go through extra steps to access this information, like scanning a QR code. TTB should not allow QR codes as an alternative to on-package labeling.  <br/><br/>Please prioritize transparency and health over corporate interests and require comprehensive labeling on the physical package to ensure that Americans who drink have access to vital information and make more informed decisions about what and how much to drink. <br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>willow chang

USDA has the authority to require all regulated animal businesses, including puppy breeders, comply with the minimum standards of the Animal Welfare Act. It's time they used that authority to put animal abusers out of business.<br/><br/>Because USDA enforcement against violators is deplorably slow, automatic license renewal means that businesses that abuse animals continue to operate while USDA plods toward enforcement, most often just issuing a warning letter. <br/><br/>I urge you to make the changes necessary to require Animal Welfare Act compliance before renewing licenses.

INFO - Comment: Animal welfare is important to me. According to numerous polls, it is also important to a majority of consumers who purchase meat and poultry products. Unfortunately, consumers who want to support higher-welfare farmers cannot rely on "free range" or similar claims, because the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service fails to adequately regulate the use of these claims.<br/><br/>When I see the claims "free range" and "pasture raised," I understand them to mean more than just limited access to the outdoors. These animals should have consistent, easy access to range that includes soil, vegetation, and plenty of room to roam, as well as shelter from extreme weather events and protection from predators. I also believe that the FSIS should not allow producers to define these claims themselves.<br/><br/>In 2015, the Animal Welfare Institute investigated the FSIS's label approval process for more than 100 approved labels containing "free range" claims. AWI found that<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>for "free range" and "range grown," the FSIS applied an overly permissive definition that allows consumers to be misled about the quality of the products they are purchasing; and<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>the FSIS is approving some label applications despite little or no evidence for the particular animal production claim being made. <br/><br/>I was disappointed to see these results, and hope that the USDA will work to improve its label approval process. It can do this by strengthening the "outdoor access" requirements for animal products marketed as "free range" and "pasture raised." These similar (though not equivalent) claims represent far more than simple access to the outdoors. The FSIS should establish minimum standards for such claims, making it clear that limited access to gravel and concrete lots is insufficient, and that free access to soil and vegetation throughout the growing season is required.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my request.

That is why Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, to provide wide scale relief as quickly as possible directly to students. The more than $6 billion in emergency student grant aid was meant to be widely available to support the academic futures of college students. Requiring students to demonstrate that they are eligible for federal financial aid dollars will exclude large numbers of students, many of whom are historically marginalized. <br/><br/>Students are already experiencing delays in receiving emergency aid because the Department of Education gave colleges mixed messages about who is eligible to receive the funds. Students deserve the emergency aid Congress intended them to receive; and many are in desperate need of it to continue their education.<br/><br/>Most concerningly, large numbers of students will be excluded, including many historically marginalized students. For instance, undocumented students, borrowers who have defaulted on their loans and are currently enrolled in school, and students with poor grades will be excluded from this funding. These are students who arguably need more help, not less, to complete their college education.<br/><br/>This interim final rule will only harm students and create more confusion for colleges.  And implementing it will disproportionately harm the nations most vulnerable students who are simply trying to improve their futures. I urge the Department to withdraw its interim final rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Susan Babbitt<br/>Philadelphia, PA 19107

The Roadless Rule was implemented with unprecedented public support to protect some of our nation’s most pristine public lands, including large parts of the Tongass National Forest. It retains wide bipartisan support, including from 96 percent of people who commented on the recent rollback of the rule in Alaska. <br/><br/>In the middle of multiple national crises, the Trump administration focused on finalizing its plan to remove crucial protections for Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, serving industry interests aiming to open the forests to clear-cutting. Anything other than a full reinstatement of the Roadless Rule will have far-reaching impacts on indigenous communities, climate, and wildlife, and ignores overwhelming public support for the safeguard, including from Alaska Natives, Alaskans, and taxpayers across the nation.  <br/><br/>President-elect Biden promised bold climate action — and full protection of the Tongass is an integral part of that.

The previous administrations expansion of the definition of sex in this section to include gender identity could have tragic repercussions if it were ever implemented.  I am glad to see you clarifying that sex should be defined by its ordinary meaning.<br/><br/>Though it supports the ideology of gender identity, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) understands the binary nature of sex and the need for the distinction. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) the APA defines sex as the Biological indication of male and female (understood in the context of reproductive capacity), such as sex chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, and nonambiguous internal and external genitalia.<br/><br/>If doctors and scientists treated patients without considering their biological makeup patient outcomes would suffer. Just recently, a woman lost her baby because she presented to the hospital as male and her symptoms werent properly diagnosed.<br/><br/>Additionally, this change is consistent with the rest of the Trump Administration and Congressional interpretation.  In October of 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a memo to all United States Attorneys and heads of department components regarding employment sex discrimination cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  This memo states that "Sex is ordinarily defined to mean biologically male or female. . . . . Congress has confirmed this ordinary meaning [] in several other statutes[.] Congress has repeatedly declined to enact legislation to include gender identity in the definition of sex in various areas of nondiscrimination law and any such change should be the prerogative of Congress, not the agencies.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Belinda Kangombe

March-in rights are intended to only be used in four specific circumstances and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has historically denied every march-in request because the correct circumstances have never been met. Misusing march-in rights will have little to no impact on the cost of medicines, and will only hold back critical research and development for treatments that patients are waiting for.<br/><br/>Please protect our nation's ability to bring new treatments and cures from a research lab to a patient's medicine cabinet.

Without them, millions of Americans will likely face increased costs at the pharmacy, and for many, this change could cause them to abandon critical treatments. <br/><br/>It is up to insurance companies to determine where the savings from cost-sharing assistance programs are applied, either passed along to the patients or kept by the health insurer. However, this rule would require manufacturers to guarantee all savings are passed to the patient. Since it would be impossible for manufacturers to make that guarantee, it is likely that they would be limited in their ability to continue providing cost-sharing assistance programs. <br/><br/>As a result, if this provision moves forward, it is plain to see that these vital programs are in critical danger. Ultimately, this rule could put in jeopardy the financial assistance millions of Americans rely upon to get the prescription medications they need. <br/><br/>For these reasons, I urge you to protect patient access to cost-sharing assistance by removing this provision from the final Medicaid rule. By doing so, you will help protect access to the medications Americans need to maintain their health.

I am especially concerned with impacts to seabirds and other wildlife.   Each year, tens of thousands of albatross and petrels are killed in longlines. These fishing practices can be easily changed to reduce the mortality to these birds -- some of which are endangered. This is just one example of how fishery management is not only destroying resources below the seas, as fisheries collapse, but also are impacting other species that are tied to ocean systems.  Now there is a proposal to weaken public participation in decisions that affect oceans by taking the National Environmental Policy Act out of the equation and replacing it with a process that is totally inadequate.  I believe that strong environmental review is critical to the health of our oceans. Citizens must have a voice in how public resources are managed. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has made it possible to protect thousands of square miles of deep sea coral formations, save the lives of endangered sea turtles and seabirds, and begin rebuilding of depleted fish populations. It must continue to have a role in fishery management.   Unfortunately the National Marine Fisheries Agency's proposed NEPA rule hands over too much authority to fishery management councils that have a long history of poor management, significantly limits the public's ability to participate in fishery management decisions, and allows fishery managers to make decisions about fishing without fully considering the impacts on seabirds, sea turtles, seals, corals and other precious ocean life.  Please withdraw this flawed NEPA proposal and craft a new one that will ensure protection of our ocean ecosystems. Our oceans are in trouble. I've seen in my own life how decades of mismanagement have degraded the oceans. It's time for our nation's fisheries managers to make better decisions by fully understanding the consequences of fishing on marine ecosystems.   Thank you for your time and consideration.
