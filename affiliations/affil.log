INFO - Comment: I am writing to express profound concerns regarding the proposed IRS rule defining “broker” within the digital asset industry.<br/>As written, the rule’s broad definition of “broker” would include numerous actors within the digital asset industry that in no way fit the traditional understanding of the term. The inclusion of certain decentralized platforms betrays a misunderstanding of how peer-to-peer networks function and would create unmeetable burdens for innovative platforms that empower individuals, families and businesses across the country.<br/>This rule will force decentralized platforms to centralize operations, restrict much needed innovation and threaten economic growth by forcing digital asset providers overseas. This rule will put the put the IRS directly into user wallets and threaten the privacy and security of law-abiding Americans. Finally, this rule will devastate U.S. global competitiveness in innovation.<br/>I urge you to withdraw this misguided rule.

INFO - Comment: From: David Goldman [mailto:david@gkmllp.com] <br/>Sent: Monday, August 23, 2010 6:02 PM<br/>To: *Public_Liaison<br/>Subject: IRS should slow down implementing tax preparer registration proposal<br/><br/>Dear Sir or Madam<br/><br/>I urge the IRS to exempt CPA firms from the requirement to register their employees who are <br/>non-signing tax return preparers, and I urge the IRS to delay the implementation of its <br/>preparer examination.<br/><br/>I am a CPA and I support the goals to increase compliance and raise the ethical conduct of <br/>paid preparers embodied in your proposal to regulate paid income tax preparers.  However, <br/>the costs and burdens of this proposal go too far, too fast – we need to see a reasoned, <br/>rational approach that creates benefits that outweigh the burdens on the CPA preparer <br/>community and ultimately the tax-paying public.<br/><br/>CPA firms stand behind the work done by the CPAs and employees of their firms.  Requiring <br/>PTINs on tax returns should give the IRS enough information to track and weed out <br/>incompetent preparers, WITHOUT the need to require PTINs for non-signing preparers who <br/>work at CPA firms.  CPAs are already regulated by state boards of accountancy and <br/>Treasury Department Circular 230, so I believe strongly that the PTIN requirement should not <br/>be extended to non-signing preparers at CPA firms.<br/><br/>I also feel strongly that the exam component should be delayed until evidence is gathered <br/>that proves the need for such an exam. The goal is to raise competency and ethical conduct; <br/>therefore, the PTIN tracking proposal should be given time to do just that, before layering on <br/>potentially unnecessary and redundant regulatory burdens on CPA firms in particular, and on <br/>all preparers and the public.  In addition, I have concerns about certain aspects of the <br/>proposed Circular 230 rules that were recently released. <br/><br/>I request that the IRS:  (1) exempt CPA firms from the non-signing preparer requirements of <br/>the proposed regulations, and (2) delay the implementation of the exam requirement until the <br/>PTIN process is fully implemented and results are known.  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of my thoughts on these important issues.<br/><br/>David Goldman<br/><br/>An Independent Member of the BDO Seidman Alliance<br/><br/> Goldman Kurland and Mohidin LLP<br/><br/>Certified Public Accountants and Advisors<br/><br/>16133 Ventura Blvd.<br/><br/>Suite 880<br/><br/>Encino, CA 91436<br/><br/> <br/><br/>818-784-9000<br/><br/>818-784-9010 (fax)<br/><br/>www.gkmllp.com<br/><br/>

INFO - Comment: I am appalled that our treasured national parks and monuments, like the Bears Ears National Monument, are up for review at all. Bears Ears is one of our nation's newest monuments -- the American people are very lucky to now call this ancient site covering an expanse of 1.3 million acres a public resource protected for future generations. The monument protects ancient sites that are sacred to the Native American tribes in southern Utah's red-rock country. Utah is greatly enriched by the Bears Ears National Monument. Bears Ears National Monument also provides incredible spaces for outdoor activities-- it is one of best places in the world for rock climbing and bouldering. These public lands need to stay in public hands. No president has EVER attempted to abolish a national monument, and an attack on one park is an attack on all our parks. Secretary Zinke, I am adamantly opposed to any effort to eliminate or diminish protections for Bears Ears or any other national monument, and I urge you to support our public lands and waters and recommend that our current national monuments remain protected.

INFO - Comment: As a consumer of organics, I expect that the certified organic food and non-food products I buy do not contain harmful chemicals. I also expect those foods and products to be produced in ways that do not pollute or harm the environment.<br/><br/>Why are PFAS chemicals not prohibited substances under the National Organic Program? This is a disastrous omission. These synthetic, ultra-toxic, carcinogenic and endocrine disrupting chemicals are called forever chemicals because they don’t break down. PFAS are linked to numerous diseases, and pollute our air, water, soil and food.<br/><br/>I am aghast that a recent pilot study found higher levels of PFAS chemicals in organic kale than in conventional kale. This is not acceptable.<br/><br/>I am also aware of the harm microplastics and the thousands of chemicals that leach from them could potentially cause. Microplastics should not be present in organic foods and products. Yet, they are.<br/><br/>The National Organic Standards Board must implement the following:<br/>1. Place entire class of PFAS chemicals on the National List of Prohibited Substances.<br/>2. Phase out use of fluorinated plastic containers and packaging.<br/>3. Phase out use of all fossil fuel-based plastic containers and packaging.<br/>4. Phase out use of plastic mulch and tarps for growing.<br/>5. Compile and post in the Federal Register a list of all “inert” ingredients used in organic production and begin evaluating them. Toxic synthetic “inert” ingredients must be phased out.<br/><br/>The organic sector has a duty to exclude harmful substances, materials and practices whenever sufficient evidence arises to prove harm. There is more than enough scientific evidence to show that PFAS chemicals and microplastics do not belong in organic food and products. And we need to know what “inert” substances are being used and if they are toxic.<br/><br/>Implementing the above 5 actions would help organic consumers like me to reduce my exposure to those dangerous toxins. Implementing these actions would bring the National Organic Program closer to what consumers expect and are paying a premium for.<br/><br/>The relevant research can be found here: https://toxinfreeusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/AMS-NOP-23-0026-0002_Comments_to_NOSB_Fall_2023_Meeting.pdf<br/><br/>And here: https://www.beyondpesticides.org/assets/media/documents/Inert%20Ingredients%20in%20Organic%20Production.FULLreport.final.pdf

Four million patients depend on Title X for birth control, cancer screenings, STD testing and treatment, and other critical health care. We all deserve access to full information and care no matter how much money we make or where we live. I oppose any and all policies that interfere with access to basic preventive care and demand that HHS stops this rule now.

INFO - Comment: To whom it may concern:<br/><br/>As a Catholic, I object to this proposed rule because it would rescind important protections which safeguard the conscience rights of medical professionals and institutions. Catholics believe that it is a grave sin to participate or assist in any way in immoral procedures such as abortions, transgender mutilation surgeries, sterilizations, assisted suicides, and others. Any sincere Catholic asked to assist in such procedures would have to choose between his faith or his job. No person should be forced by the government to make such a choice.<br/><br/>But the proposed rule would weaken protections and increase the likelihood that Catholic healthcare professionals and practices would have to make that choice. This rule sets a standard that someone's desire for an abortion, transgender mutilation surgery, or other procedure trumps the rights of conscience of healthcare workers. The First Amendment guarantees freedom of religion, and no healthcare worker should be pressured to violate his or her faith. As Pope Francis has said, conscientious objection is "the ultimate responsibility of healthcare professionals ... and should never be negotiated."<br/><br/>I urge the rejection of this proposed rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>William Hogan<br/>Lake Saint Louis, MO

The ability to use dicamba with dicamba- tolerant soybeans and dicamba- and glufosinate-tolerant cotton will help reduce the risk of additional weeds developing resistance to other pre and post emergent herbicides.  <br/><br/>Dicamba has a long history of safe and effective use in the U.S. and 25 other countries spanning decades in corn, wheat, fallow and pasture land, conservation tillage acres, as well as homeowner uses.<br/><br/>USDA needs to move quickly to approve these important new technologies.  It is important to ensure the USDA regulatory review of these new biotech traits and EPA approval of new formulations and new uses does not fall further behind those of other major crop producing countries impacting a US farmers competitiveness in the global marketplace.  Both the dicamba tolerant soybean trait and a dicamba chemistry approval for an over the top application have already been approved in Canada.<br/><br/>We rely on our regulatory system to support innovation in agriculture to help U.S. farmers grow food in a sustainable way while maintaining their competitive edge. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to provide a comment.

Unfortunately, the revised rule caters to the interests of schools that continually engage in deceptive behavior and guts critical protections for borrowers that have been taken advantage of by their institutions.    <br/><br/>First, the rule requires students prove their institution intentionally defrauded them, meaning students will have to provide evidence of their institutions intent to mislead them. This requirement places a disproportionate burden on the backs of students that have already suffered financial harm, the burden should instead fall on the Department to investigate and collect evidence for borrower defense claims.  <br/><br/>Second, the Department should not limit claims to students who have already defaulted on their loans or are already in some form of debt collection. By the time a borrower enters default their ability to buy a home, develop good credit, or navigate financial hardship is significantly limited. This requirement demonstrates yet again the administrations willingness to protect the needs of potentially fraudulent institutions at the expense of students financial security. <br/><br/>Third, the new rule allows institutions to utilize a practice known as forced arbitration. Institutions will once again be allowed to compel students to sign away their legal rights, and in doing so allow the institution to continue to engage in deceitful behavior without the threat of substantive legal action to be taken against them. <br/> <br/>Finally, the proposed rule would eliminate the ability of borrowers deceived by their institution to submit a group claim or get automatic relief if their school closed or shut down. In effect, in the absence of quality information or direction, this requirement severely limits the ability of borrowers to find a pathway to relief.<br/><br/>The proposed rule fails to serve the students whom the department is meant to protect. Students that have been deceived, defrauded, or taken advantage of will be met with a long and burdensome process that will fail to provide them with the justice they are due. The rule as currently proposed, fails to adequately hold institutions accountable to their actions. Under this rule, students and taxpayers will continue to pay the price for institutions deceptive and fraudulent behavior.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>William Bolin<br/>Reno, NV 89512

INFO - Title: Comment from Vincent Nguyen
INFO - Comment: Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D.<br/>U.S. Food & Drug Administration<br/><br/>Dear Commissioner Hahn:<br/><br/>I am a pharmacist who works with veterinarians to treat animal patients. I am concerned about the GFI #256 on animal drug compounding that was issued late last year. The GFI does not appear to be based on any federal statute and thus exceeds the agency's regulatory authority. If finalized in its current form, this guidance would severely limit animal drug compounding from bulk ingredients and would interfere with the state-regulated practices of pharmacy and veterinary medicine. <br/><br/>GFI #256 is similar to a previous guidance, GFI #230, issued by FDA in 2015 that was withdrawn in 2017 after complaints from veterinarians, pharmacy organizations, pet owners and Congress. Without statutory authority, GFI #256 also borrows extensively from Sections 503A (traditional human compounding) and 503B (outsourcing facility compounding for humans) of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, both of which expressly apply to human health. <br/><br/>My concerns:<br/><br/> GFI #256 requires that FDA-approved manufactured drugs be used in animal compounding. Congress has specifically authorized compounding from bulk API in human compounding, however, so this GFI is more stringent than Congress has authorized for humans. FDA has provided no data or justification for why compounds prepared using FDA-approved drugs are deemed safer than those prepared from bulk API. The stipulation to compound only from manufactured drugs in animal compounding is not workable for several reasons, among them:<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>-Some compounders report they are unable to obtain FDA-approved drugs for compounding from manufacturers. The manufacturers refuse sell the drug for purposes of compounding.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>-The FDA-allowed deviation from labeled potency of FDA-approved drugs can result in serious variances in potency of animal meds compounded from FDA-approved drugs. With bulk API, the compounder has a Certificate of Analysis showing the exact potency of the substance and is required by USP standards to do additional testing as well.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>-Required use of FDA-approved drugs in animal compounding will significantly increase costs to animal owners because FDA-approved drugs almost always cost more - in many cases much more - than bulk API.<br/><br/>GFI #256 is an intrusion into the practice of veterinary medicine, impinging on veterinarians' medical judgment in determining what medication is best to treat animal patients. GFI #256 will force vets to document that a compounded drug produces a clinical difference in their animal patient and that there is medical rationale for the prescription - a requirement not placed on other prescribers. In any other setting, the prescription itself serves as documentation of the veterinarian's determination of clinical need.<br/><br/>GFI #256 would restrict the compounded medications veterinarians can keep in-office for immediate treatment. Compounding pharmacies will only be able to use bulk API from a positive list created by FDA - again, without statutory authority - in effect putting FDA alone in a position to make decisions about the positive list and to reject substances based on its perceptions of FDA-approved products being able to meet the need in animal health, when in reality those products do not meet the needs. <br/> <br/>FDA's proposed positive list for bulk ingredients will severely restrict veterinarians' ability to obtain compounded medications for office use even if state law allows it. This provision is particularly dangerous for animal health because veterinary clinics serve as hospitals and emergency rooms, and vets must have certain compounded medications available to meet immediate needs of animal patients. In addition, some vets must travel to the animal patient to provide treatment, and thus often need compounded medications on hand to administer on-site.<br/><br/>The GFI would require that labels on compounded drugs for animal health instruct that adverse events be reported directly to FDA instead of initially to the pharmacy and/or state board of pharmacy. This proposed regime circumvents the pharmacy - and therefore any opportunity for quick remediation, much less providing expert documentation or context. As drafted, the GFI is likely to result in FDA receiving "junk" reports of so-called adverse events that may in fact be normal effects of a compounded medication.<br/><br/>Congress specifically chose not to include provisions regarding animal health in the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013. FDA should not be allowed to act as if it has statutory authority that clearly does not exist. For these reasons, I respectfully request that GFI #256 be withdrawn.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Betsy Devos,<br/><br/>Our Nation SHOULD NOT GO BACKWARDS in protecting minorities like gays, people of color, etc.  <br/><br/>I urge you to reject the Departments proposal to change the rules that apply to taxpayer-funded faith-based organizations that deliver social services. The proposed changes would harm religious freedom.<br/><br/>The proposed rules strip away religious freedom protections from people, often vulnerable and marginalized, who use government-funded social services. Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.<br/> <br/>At the same time, the rules expand religious exemptions to taxpayer-funded faith-based providers. This paves the way for providers to refuse to provide key services and opens the door to discrimination in taxpayer-funded programs. The proposed regulations put the interests of taxpayer-funded entities, some of which receive millions of dollars each year of government money, ahead of the needs of people seeking critical services.<br/> <br/>I urge you to reject these proposed changes and protect, rather than undermine, the rights of individuals your social service programs are designed to serve.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ann Morris Cockrell Cockrell

INFO - Title: Comment on CMS-2020-0088-1604
INFO - Comment: I appreciate the opportunity to provide comments to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in response to the 2021 Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule.<br/> <br/>First, I strongly oppose CMS’ significant payment reductions for physical therapy services. If the 9% cut is implemented, physical therapy providers, many of whom are small business owners, will become insolvent and therefore unavailable to treat Medicare beneficiaries, including Medicare Advantage enrollees. The result of this proposal will be massive unemployment; the shuttering of many small business (including in rural communities); delivery of unskilled care; significant declines in beneficiaries’ quality of life; and increased morbidity and mortality – all of which lead to greater costs and burdens on the already taxed health care system. The ripple effect that this decision will have across the provider community is monumental. CMS must immediately halt implementation of the 9% reduction to physical therapy services.<br/> <br/>Second, I strongly recommend that CMS include in the list of covered telehealth services the following CPT codes: 97161, 97162, 97163, 97164, 97165, 97166, 97167, 97168, 97110, 97112, 97116, 97535, 97750, 97755, 97760, 97761, and 97530 and 97763. The expansion of telehealth payment and practice policies to allow physical therapists in private practice and facility-based physical therapy providers during this public health emergency has demonstrated that many needs can be effectively met via the use of technology and that patients can have improved access to skilled care by leveraging these resources. Adding these CPT codes to the list of covered telehealth services will better ensure a seamless transition when additional practitioners, such as physical therapists, become eligible to furnish and bill for telehealth services under Medicare. Moreover, adding these CPT codes, even on a temporary basis, will allow therapists who work “incident to” physicians to continue to furnish telehealth services when appropriate, therefore ensuring continued access and improving beneficiaries’ satisfaction after the PHE ends.<br/>Third, I strongly support CMS’ proposal to permanently allow physical therapists to furnish and bill e-visits, remote assessment of recorded video and/or images submitted by an established patient, and brief communication technology-based service, e.g., virtual check-in. However, I recommend that CMS clarify in final rulemaking that facility-based therapy providers, who have been identified as eligible to furnish and bill these communication technology-based services during the PHE, also are recognized as eligible to furnish and bill these codes on a permanent basis.<br/>Fourth, I respectfully disagree with CMS’ interpretation that CPT codes 99453, 99454, 99091, 99457, and 99458 can only be furnished and billed by physicians or practitioners who are eligible to bill Medicare for E/M services. Physical therapists are recognized by the American Medical Association as qualified health care professionals and the CPT codes at issue are not restricted to use solely by physicians and others who may bill E/M services. Physical therapists use remote monitoring technology in treatment to shorten healing times, reduce risk for adverse events, promote patient self-efficacy, improve comfort and quality of life, and increase the overall quality and options of care available. Physical therapists use accelerometers and devices that collect physiologic functions both in real time (in person and remotely) and recorded. They commonly collect data that includes change in upper or lower extremity position, or displacement, that occurs over a given time period, heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, and respiration. This provides a greater understanding of performance of and response to physical activity as well as information to better gauge their home exercise program and determine the need for advancing or revising programs. Physical therapists also use accelerometry to collect data that indicates when a patient may be experiencing balance and or postural changes that may be indications of increased falls risk.<br/> <br/>Physical therapists are recognized as QHPs by AMA; the definition of QHP supports the interpretation that physical therapists are QHPs; and the remote physiologic monitoring codes are not E/M services. Therefore, CMS must revise its interpretation in final rulemaking to recognize that CPT codes 99453, 99454, 99091, 99457, and 99458 may be billed by QHPs, such as physical therapists, who meet all statutory requirements, and that the billing of these codes is not limited solely to health care professionals who can bill Medicare for E/M services.<br/> <br/>Finally, I strongly support CMS’ proposal to allow physical therapist assistants to furnish maintenance therapy under Part B.

The Trump rule targeted LGBTQ+ people and those seeking reproductive health care, including abortions. These patients already face barriers to accessing the health care they need. This proposed rule is especially important because of the increase in refusals of care following the Supreme Court’s decision declaring there is no constitutional right to abortion.  It is more important than ever to protect people seeking health care and to ensure that patient health – not personal beliefs – determines the care a patient receives. <br/><br/>Somehow or other the patient is no longer centered it’s an overreaching state government<br/><br/>We need the administration to protect patients and put this new proposed rule into effect as soon as possible!   <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this regulation.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Janet Hill<br/>Beaver, PA 15009

The changes are long overdue and will help ensure that construction workers earn fair pay and benefits for the hard work they do on federal construction projects. The proposed update will ensure that Davis-Bacon prevailing rates reflect actual wages paid to workers by restoring the three-step method for determining the prevailing wage.<br/><br/>The proposed stronger enforcement measures, including the anti-retaliation provisions, are historic and will ensure that workers who raise concerns about payment practices to DOL in investigations are protected from termination or other adverse employment actions.<br/><br/>Construction workers will also be in a better position to collect back wages owed due to wage violations by the contractor. The DOL would be empowered to withhold funds from both the same contractor and now related legal entities.<br/><br/>I urge the US Department of Labor to act quickly to finalize the proposed rule to ensure that construction workers on federally assisted projects are protected when they speak out on labor violations and can collect back wages to which they are entitled.

INFO - Comment: Dear Fish and Wildlife Service,<br/><br/>Thank you for undoing some of the Trump administration’s damage to critical Endangered Species Act regulations. I am heartened by many aspects of your proposed restoration. <br/><br/>However, there are multiple aspects of your proposed rules that are insufficient for the challenges that endangered wildlife are facing.  <br/><br/>First, you must go back to the drawing board and fully restore section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, which governs interagency consultation. For 50 years it's been established that the federal government should not engage in activities that could jeopardize species' survival or destroy habitat they need to survive and recover.  <br/><br/>Specifically, the Biden administration must rescind the addition of “as a whole” to section 402.02. This Trump-era language created an enormous loophole, inconsistent with the intent of the Endangered Species Act itself. The nefarious “as a whole” language is a free pass to destroy critical habitat as long as the total destruction of a species’ entire critical habitat is avoided. This is especially damaging for wide-ranging and migratory species, from piping plover to marbled murrelet, from salmon to lynx. This language also ignores the cumulative impact of different causes of habitat destruction over time. And it goes against the science-based establishment of critical habitat to ensure both the species survival and recovery, instead treating some areas of critical habitat as expendable.   <br/><br/>Additional definition changes from the Trump era that need to be reversed include one that creates unnecessary confusion when examining an agency action that is ongoing, or a continuation of past activities as opposed to something new (“environmental baseline” section 402.02).   <br/><br/>Additionally, you must reverse Trump’s damaging changes in section 424.11(e) that allow plants and animals to be prematurely delisted. It is essential that species recovery meets all science-based standards before removing the backstop of Endangered Species Act protections that have kept so many species alive.  <br/><br/>Each of the many changes to Endangered Species Act regulations made by the Trump administration weakened protections for threatened and endangered species at a time when we must be doing everything in our power to fight the biodiversity crisis and recover species from the brink of extinction. Despite the broad support for restoring and strengthening the rules that implement the Act, you’ve left multiple loopholes from the Trump-era rollbacks in place, which will undoubtedly jeopardize future efforts to protect wildlife and habitat. By failing to fully restore the Endangered Species Act rules, you've left a significant job less than half done. Now is the time to get this right; we have no more time to waste.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Enoe Corado<br/>PO Box 410056  San Francisco, CA 94141-0056

INFO - Comment: As a small-business operator in Kansas, I'm very disappointed to learn that the FDA is considering a ban on licensed retailers selling menthol cigarettes to adults 21 and older. Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning menthol cigarettes could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since menthol cigarettes alone make up 36% of all cigarette sales in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of menthol could undermine my ability to operate by significantly impacting my revenue. Plain and simple: it's misguided and could force small businesses to close.<br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, menthol cigarettes could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime under the laws of all 50 states.  Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of menthol cigarettes is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.<br/>

INFO - Comment: My name is Hector Gaytan, and I am a Randolph-Sheppard blind entrepreneur in TX. I am writing in<br/>opposition to the Department of Defenses proposed regulations, DFARS Case 2015-D012, because they<br/>will be harmful to blind entrepreneurs who currently hold contracts providing troop dining services<br/>and will eliminate most if not all possible future opportunities. <br/><br/>My objections are based on the following:  <br/><br/>1. The proposed rules directly conflict with current Randolph-Sheppard regulations promulgated by<br/>the U.S. Department of Education. The Randolph-Sheppard Act states that the purpose of the Act is<br/>providing blind persons with remunerative employment, enlarging the economic opportunities of the<br/>blind, and stimulating the blind to greater efforts in striving to make themselves<br/>self-supporting.  The proposed rules not only do not enlarge opportunities but severely limit<br/>them.  This is just one example of how the proposed rule violates the Act.  By what authority can<br/>DOD promulgate regulations that conflict with regulations of the federal agency charged with<br/>administering the Randolph-Sheppard Program?<br/><br/>2. In 2012, President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum directing federal agencies to act<br/>affirmatively to create opportunities for Randolph-Sheppard vendors.  Specifically, he said I<br/>direct all agencies that have property management responsibilities to ensure that agency officials,<br/>when pursuing the establishment and operation of vending facilities (including cafeterias and<br/>military dining facilities) as defined in 20 U.S.C. 107e issue permits and contracts in compliance<br/>with the Randolph-Sheppard Program and consistent with existing regulations and law.  DODs<br/>proposed rules directly conflict with the Presidents directive.  By what authority can DOD ignore<br/>and contradict a directive from the Commander in Chief?   <br/><br/>3.  DOD is promulgating these regulations under the guise that Congress instructed it to do so to<br/>implement the 2006 Joint Policy Statement. No member of Congress ever voted to direct DOD to take<br/>such action. Furthermore, the rules go beyond what was stated in the Joint Policy Statement in many<br/>regards. <br/><br/>4. These regulations narrow the scope of services that are covered by the Randolph-Sheppard<br/>priority. The Randolph-Sheppard regulations promulgated by the Department of Education, pursuant to<br/>authority explicitly granted by Congress, provide that the Randolph-Sheppard priority applies to<br/>all contracts or other arrangements pertaining to the operation of cafeterias on Federal property,<br/>and courts and federal arbitration panels have confirmed that application.  DODs proposed<br/>regulations would severely narrow the application of the Randolph-Sheppard priority, from all<br/>services pertaining to the operation of a cafeteria to only contracts for the exercise of<br/>management responsibility and day-to-day decision-making authority by a contractor for the overall<br/>functioning of a military dining facility.   By what authority can DOD overrule the Department of<br/>Education regulations and the court and arbitration panel rulings interpreting those regulations?<br/><br/>5. The proposed regulations create ambiguity in a number of areas. They leave open the possibility<br/>of mandatory subcontracting with SourceAmerica agencies. Such a requirement would add significant<br/>costs to the federal government, as it has been well established that such services cost more than<br/>those competitively bid. It would also substantially reduce the profits of the blind entrepreneur. <br/>Why is DOD so determined to promulgate rules that will cost our nation's taxpayers more money?<br/><br/>6. The rules also create ambiguity when it comes to pricing and evaluating proposals submitted by<br/>State Licensing Agencies. <br/><br/>7. Finalizing these rules in their current form will result in a waste of government resources, as<br/>vendors adversely affected will most assuredly file in federal court to challenge DOD's authority to<br/>promulgate such regulations and the legality of regulations that so blatantly violate the<br/>Randolph-Sheppard Act. It will result in an unnecessary waste of the federal governments resources,<br/>both time and money, to litigate this matter. I am confident that Randolph-Sheppard will prevail.<br/>Again, I ask why does DOD insist on such wasteful spending?<br/><br/>For the reasons I have outlined above, I urge DOD to withdraw these regulations and defer to the<br/>Department of Education to interpret the Randolph-Sheppard Act, as it was charged to do by Congress<br/>or at the very least revise the rules so that they reflect the Department of Education's rules as<br/>set forth in 34 C.F.R.  395.33.

INFO - Comment: I urge the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries to rescind in full the 2019 Trump-era regulations that severely weakened protections for our nation’s most imperiled animals and plants. These changes represented the most significant rollbacks to the Endangered Species Act in the law’s 50-year history and pushed hundreds of species closer to the brink of extinction.  <br/> <br/>It is extremely disappointing that this proposed rule retains a number of harmful provisions governing the responsibility of federal agencies to avoid jeopardizing protected species or adversely modifying their critical habitat. In particular, it retains a definition of “adverse modification” that requires federal actions to affect species’ critical habitat “as a whole” before real habitat protections are put in place. This is especially harmful for species like the northern spotted owl, polar bear or gulf sturgeon that have large critical habitat designations but are still at risk of extinction. The provision ignores the basic fact that the single largest driver of extinction here and around the world is habitat loss and allows the Services to turn a blind eye to the vast majority of actions that harm critical habitat.  <br/> <br/>The proposed rule also retains the Trump-era definition of “environmental baseline,” which lets federal agencies off the hook for past harms to endangered species from things like dam or highway construction by deeming these projects part of the baseline. It absolves the agencies of much responsibility for the damage caused by interrelated actions they facilitate, such as urban growth from highway expansion or increased global warming from emissions related to federal oil and gas leasing.  <br/> <br/>The remaining Trump-era regulations that the agencies are proposing to retain — including the criteria for not prudent determinations for critical habitat — are equally problematic and will continue to put endangered species at greater risk of extinction. Thus, I urge the Services to rescind them in their entirety without exception. <br/> <br/>There are some aspects of the proposed rule that I support. I am grateful that the Biden administration plans to restore the “blanket 4(d) rule,” which will restore protections for threatened species. I also support reinserting the provision that prohibits consideration of economic impacts when deciding to protect species, as well as the provision that removes barriers to designate critical habitat for climate-impacted species.  <br/><br/>However, while the proposed rule restores some pieces of the Endangered Species Act regulations, it is wholly inadequate and represents a huge missed opportunity to make meaningful progress to recover our most vulnerable animals and plants on the 50th anniversary of the Act’s passage.  <br/> <br/>With time running out, we can’t afford more of the status quo. Combating the global wildlife extinction crisis will require the Services to be bolder and more visionary than any other administration in history. For these reasons, I urge the Services to not only rescind the Trump-era rollbacks in their entirety, but to also strengthen the implementation of the Endangered Species Act to avert the extinction crisis and curtail the ongoing loss of biodiversity in the United States and around the world.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Debra Haaland,<br/><br/>I am writing to you today to express my opposition to Gulf-wide leasing in the oil and gas lease sales 259 and 261. <br/><br/>The Inflation Reduction Act does not require the administration to lease the entire Western and Central Gulf. Nor does it mandate any particular results from those sales. Rather, Congress, through both the IRA and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, empowered Interior to determine the size, location, and conditions for offshore leasing sales and preserved Interior’s authority to decide whether to issue a lease. And BOEM has the obligation to make those decisions based on a full evaluation of the environmental effects that leasing will cause – including climate pollution, oil spills, and harms to the critically endangered Rice’s whale. <br/><br/>There is simply no need for BOEM to continue with the large-scale lease sales we saw for four years under the Trump administration. Oil companies currently hold close to 1,900 leases covering more than 10 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico. Only about 500 of those leases are currently in production, meeting the current demand for offshore oil and gas and leaving more than 7.4 million leased acres (or 75% of current lease holdings) remaining to be developed to meet any near or mid-term national energy needs. <br/><br/>Moreover, massive area-wide lease sales are fundamentally incompatible with the Biden administration’s commitments to fight climate change. Decisions we make now about additional leases have no effect on current or even near-term energy needs because new leases typically take a decade to produce any oil. And because of the long-term nature of oil and gas development, leasing now locks in investments in fossil fuels for decades to come, long after the time when the United States and the world must transition to a clean energy economy if we are to avoid the more catastrophic impacts of climate change.   <br/><br/>Finally, continuing with massive leases sales increases the already dire harm to Gulf wildlife – like the 50 remaining critically endangered Rice’s whale – and to Gulf communities, which have disproportionately borne the brunt of the country’s fossil fuel addiction for far too long. Locking in new leases means locking in continued harm for decades to come and will only slow the needed rapid phase-out of fossil fuel from the nation’s energy portfolio.   <br/><br/>I urge you to not sell off millions of acres of Gulf leases and to use your authority and ample discretion to instead accelerate the rapid transition to the clean energy future the country needs!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Andrea O'Sullivan<br/>Norwalk, CT 06851

This training would be life saving for our brothers who are going through tough times and don’t speak about it and may not know how to deal with it. We are told to leave our feelings at home and to have tough skin but the truth is that is just plain ignorant. If we care about our future in the construction industry, then this would be the first step in the right direction.

Support animals are frequently utilized to help people who have been dealing with some kind of trauma. Feelings of loneliness. This is important for those that live alone, especially if they also experience depression and anxiety.<br/><br/>I don't promote this principle change.

INFO - Comment: Alexander Acosta,<br/><br/>Back in 1975, President Gerald Fords Labor Department set the salary level for overtime exemption at the equivalent of about $58,000 in todays dollarshigh enough to cover more than 50 percent of full-time salaried workers. The Obama-era rule set it at $47,476high enough to cover about 34 percent of full-time salaried employees but lower than the level that it was in the 1970s. Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people. The whole point of having national standards is to ensure decent basic standards for all workers. The updated overtime standard is already linked to the lowest-wage Census region. Workers rights and wages should not be undercut even further by weakening the salary threshold.<br/><br/>Marcia Reau<br/>marcia.reau@utoledo.edu<br/>2602 Ralphwood<br/>Toledo, OH, Ohio 43613

INFO - Comment: Dear Janet Coit, Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA<br/><br/>Rice’s whale, also known as the Gulf of Mexico whale, may be one of the most endangered whales on the planet. <br/><br/>Rice’s whales suffered significant losses due to the Deepwater Horizon spill and face a myriad of other threats. Their habitat is severely degraded due to oil and gas development, and they are at continuing risk from oil spills. Vessel noise, plastics and other marine debris, and fishing gear entanglements all pose additional threats.<br/><br/>If more than one whale is lost every 15 years, the species may never recover. Deaths from vessel strikes alone are highly likely to exceed this number. Immediate management actions are therefore needed to reduce the risk of vessel strikes and other vessel-related impacts if the species is to survive. <br/><br/>Given that slower ships are far less likely to fatally strike whales, slowing vessels in their habitat is the most effective way for NOAA Fisheries to protect Rice’s whales and fulfill its legal obligations under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. Reducing nighttime transits is also important, since the whales are known to rest just below the surface at night.<br/><br/>Though time is running out, it is not too late to save this remarkable species. Please, I urge you to issue regulations that protect Rice’s whales from preventable ship strikes in their habitat.

INFO - Comment: Dear David Bernhart,<br/><br/>I am writing to you today in support of the proposal to set a year-round 10-knot vessel speed restriction in parts of the Gulf of Mexico to protect the endangered Rice’s whale from collisions and noise pollution. <br/><br/>Fossil fuel exploration development and other human activities have made the Rice’s whale one of the most endangered large whale species in the world. Your own scientists have concluded that the death of even a single reproductive-age female would jeopardize the existence of this species.  <br/><br/>So, any way to mitigate risks to these whales’ survival should be implemented immediately.  This includes mandatory speed limits and other reasonable measures governing vessel traffic within the whales’ habitat:  <br/><br/>** a mandatory 10-knot speed limit; <br/>** no vessel transits at night; <br/>** utilize visual observers and maintain a separation distance of 500 m from Rice's whales; <br/>** use and operate an Automatic Identification System, or notify NMFS of transits through the habitat;  <br/>** and report deviations from these requirements to NMFS. <br/><br/>Based on the latest science showing that these whales are persistently found in waters 100-400 meters deep all the way to the U.S.-Mexico border, these measures are needed not only within the whales’ previously identified “core habitat,” but throughout the Gulf.  Slowing down for Gulf of Mexico whales is a key step and only one part of the protection that is needed. These whales can recover as long as conditions improve, but that all depends on our actions. Unless the Biden administration takes significant conservation actions, the U.S. is likely to cause the first extinction of a great whale species resulting from human activity. We cannot let that happen.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Bonnie Arbuckle<br/>Riverbank, CA 95367

INFO - Title:    B. J. Bennett  
INFO - Comment: It is not practical for airlines to report incidents of loss, injury or death to all warm and cold blooded animals, as currently proposed by the FAA.  For example, this would require air carriers to assess the health of tropical fish, reptiles, scorpions, and many other species.  If air carriers are required to do this, more of them may decide to embargo carrying animals at all, such as some "low cost" carriers already do.  Continental no longer carries animals.  This would be detrimental to the very public whose interests this rule is designed to serve.  I believe that the reporting of incidents should be restricted to dogs and cats only.  These are the species that were of concern to Congress in the consideration of the underlying legislation that led to this rule.  I believe that the proposed rule defines "incident' too broadly.  A carrier should be required to initiate an investigation and file a report only when a complaint of loss, injury or death of a dog or cat has been filed by the owner or shipper.  I am also concerned about the privacy of persons who ship dogs & cats which may be involved in an incident, as defined by the FAA.  I believe the FAA rule should make clear that only the number, nature and cause of incidents should be publicly reported.  Information about the name of the owner and the name of the animal involved in the incident should not be included in information about incidents which are reported to or made available to the public.  I object to the use of the word "guardian" in the proposed rule.  "Guardian" is a meaningless term and reflect a political agenda that is not relevant to this issue and is unnecessary.  People who own animals are "Owners" not "guardians" as in "guardian angel".  There is a big difference!!  Reports should list the animals owner and/or the consignor and consignee of the shipment.  I understand that the American Kennel Club will submit a more detailed and comprehensive comment letter on this proposed rule.  The AKC's objectives are to assure safe travel for animals while assuring access to air travel at reasonable cost to the public.  I agree with those objectives and would like to associate myself with the comments of the AKC.  I strongly urge the FAA to modify the proposed ruleby taking into account the comments above and those of the American Kennel Club (AKC).

This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.<br/><br/>For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.<br/><br/>Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.<br/><br/>I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence.

INFO - Comment: Like patients and providers, public and population health continue to face obstacles in mobilizing clinical care / EHR data. Public health has needs for ongoing support to establish and to maintain clinical care connections that manifest the nations health surveillance infrastructure. CMS and ONC have, to this point, focused principally on federal laws and on goals for patients and providers. But many of the benefits of health IT accrue in support of population health outcomes. And many of these public and population health activities are state and not federal responsibilities. <br/>- Electronic data are now the sine qua non for health information exchange and the federal agencies need to ensure that state and local laws are now fully supported electronically. To point, information blocking regulations should specifically identify failures to electronically support state laws like those that require the reporting of specific conditions. These state laws should not be menu choices for providers or optional implementations for EHR vendors. Specific language should be included in this new regulation that indicates that the failure to support state mandated reporting can be considered information blocking and subject to information blocking penalties.<br/>- Some public health programs benefited from Meaningful Use and some, to a much lesser degree, from Promoting Interoperability. However, many of these public health programs are still incompletely implemented and, resultantly, do not fully manifest opportunities to reduce provider burden from the automation of activities they seek to implement. In fact, legally mandated public health reporting was even cited in ONCs provider burden strategy. The programs for automating reporting need to be sufficiently supported in this regulation so that state laws are automatically addressed, and manual reporting is not otherwise considered a burden.<br/>- While state law-driven activities are not fully considered by these regulations, the definitions included in this NPRM are broad enough that public health agencies and systems could actually be construed as being in-scope for the penalties of these regulations as perpetuating information blocking themselves. We strongly suggest that public health organizations and their activities related to interoperability be clearly excluded from consideration of blocking information.<br/>- With the importance of public health surveillance, the failure of a certified product to support state laws and report to public health should not only be information blocking but should also be justification for suspension or termination of product certification. This is an issue of public health and safety as noted on page 316.<br/>- Public health programs need reliable and ongoing inducements for clinical care to initiate and maintain electronic connections. The menu choices of Promoting Interoperability have greatly reduced the inducements to initiate connections and there are few ongoing drivers to re-connect when clinical care system changes inevitably happen. EHR upgrades should not mean that legally mandated reporting stops.<br/>ONC is proposing to permit EHR health IT developers to use new versions of standards once these new versions are identified by the ONC. Many standards, however, involve data exchange between more than one organization. Without both sides of an exchange being able to operationalize a new standard, this suggested approach will be problematic.<br/>- EHR vendors should not implement new versions of interoperability standards that public health agencies are not yet prepared to support.<br/>- A more collaborative process that involves all the participants in determination of when a new standard is ready for implementation across organizational boundaries needs to be developed.<br/>ONC is seeking exceptions to the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) requirement to use voluntary consensus-based standards in several areas including the USCDI, the API Resource Collection in Health (ARCH), application programming interfaces (APIs) from consortia (like Argonaut), and more.<br/>- We do not support NTTAA exceptions for the identified activities and instead ask that the involved programs increase their support for inclusive, consensus-based standards activities that involve broad representation of industry participants - including public health. <br/>- In the past several years there has been an erosion of the consensus-based standards process with the advent of activities like some of those for which this regulation seeks exceptions (e.g. Argonaut, USCDI). Many of these activities do not have, or even allow, public health participation. Despite the lack of involvement, these processes can lead to HIT standards and infrastructure that non-participants, like public health, must then use.<br/> <br/>

INFO - Comment: I am writing to urge you to stop the changes to longstanding regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act you recently proposed. These changes would drastically weaken the interagency consultation provision of the Endangered Species Act -- widely considered the most important and effective provision of the Act -- and also undercut the Endangered Species Act's proper role in addressing the impacts of climate change on our nation's most imperiled wildlife. <br/><br/>For 35 years the Endangered Species Act has protected imperiled species from the effects of potentially harmful federal projects. The strength of the Endangered Species Act has been the checks and balances created by interagency consultation between federal agencies that build roads, issue logging permits, and lease oil and gas rights among other projects, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and National Marine Fisheries Services, whose primary responsibility is the conservation of endangered species. <br/><br/>Interagency consultation ensures that federal projects that may impact America's most imperiled wildlife are independently reviewed by federal wildlife experts and project modifications are made where necessary. In the overwhelming majority of consultations federal projects move forward with little or no significant changes.<br/><br/>The regulations you recently proposed would eliminate interagency consultation on thousands of federal projects that pose a risk to endangered and threatened species each year. The changes will almost certainly result in detrimental impacts on endangered and imperiled species and a higher propensity to overlook opportunities to avoid such impacts.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the fact that these are the most significant changes to regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act in more than 20 years, you have provided the public just 30 days in which to submit comments, not the traditional 90, and prevented anyone from sending their comments by email. <br/><br/>I request you set an additional 60 days to allow the public an opportunity to meaningfully comment on these proposed regulations.<br/><br/>I also urge you to not to finalize these regulatory changes. <br/><br/>Thank you.

We commend the agency for recognizing that these forests are already highly resilient, provide unique ecological and social values, benefit local economies, and store massive amounts of carbon. These forests could store even more carbon if we simply let them grow. It is past time for the Forest Service to take full advantage of their climate-saving potential. To that end, we call on the agency to swiftly enact a rule protecting existing old-growth forests and allowing mature forests to develop into old-growth condition.  <br/><br/>Old-growth forests once dominated the eastern United States but now only a fraction of those forests remain. Past and current logging practices have left our public forests much younger than they should be. Protecting the remaining old-growth forests and allowing mature forests to develop into old growthstoring increasing amounts of carbon as they ageis a win for the climate, biodiversity, water quality, air quality, wildlife, and communities. <br/><br/>Our eastern national forests are relatively stable and do not face the same drought and wildfire threats as western forests. These forests have high potential to continuously store more carbon for decades or centuries while gaining biodiversity and drinking water co-benefits as long as we allow them to grow. <br/><br/>The Forest Services own data explains that the primary threat to carbon storage in eastern national forests is the agencys commercial logging program. The agency routinely and needlessly targets mature and old-growth forests for logging.  Logging these carbon-dense forests releases significant amounts of carbon to the atmosphere where it exacerbates the climate crisis. The agency must forthrightly recognize the threat that logging poses to carbon storage in eastern national forests. <br/><br/>Please act swiftly to enact a rule prohibiting commercial logging of existing old growth and ensuring mature forests are allowed to develop into old growth to replenish the old growth weve lost.  Even in the face of a changing climate, the greatest threat to these forests in this regionthe Forest Services logging programis well within the agencys control. It is time to embrace the climate-saving and biodiversity-boosting power of these forests and take them off of the chopping block.

Our public lands, as well as other areas governed by these rules, provide necessary habitat for birds and excellent opportunities for recreation, among other values. It's irresponsible to reduce the ability to comment on or understand the effects of projects that impact these lands and wildlife.  <br/><br/>I have serious concerns about removing the requirement to consider all types of impacts (including indirect and cumulative impacts), which would undermine the need for agencies to consider the impacts to our climate from projects. With 3 billion birds lost from North America in the last 50 years and nearly two-thirds at risk from climate change, this is no time to ignore the likely effects of decisions. I am also concerned about expanding the use of categorical exclusions, limiting the requirement to consider alternatives to proposed actions, and allowing companies to prepare their own analyses to justify their projects. We need meaningful and unbiased review of proposed actions that could harm birds, other wildlife and all the natural resources we depend on.<br/><br/>NEPA is a bedrock environmental law that informs science-based, transparent, and accountable decision making, but this proposed rule would weaken those vital standards.

Many children have access to pornography on the Internet and it has not been extinguished or restricted.<br/> It would be nice if you were suggested to youtube to use more security features like asking for proof of age with documents (as some bank apps do) and perhaps a parental consent for children under 13 where parents determine their children's access.<br/> It's not fair to creators losing money. No one works for free and without them YouTube is gone.

INFO - Comment: As a responsible farmer and user of pest control products, my applicators and I only use bifenthrin according to label directions including mandatory restrictions. It's important to me to have both the best and multiple pest control options. I work to be an effective steward of crop chemicals by using the products responsibly including maintaining buffer zones and respecting limits on spray drift. <br/><br/>Bifenthrin insecticides have proven extremely effective in controlling many pests that are detrimental to my crops, particularly corn rootworm (CRW), which many consider to be the "billion-dollar pest" because of the massive yield damage they cause. No singular control method is completely effective against this severe pest, and I need all possible IPM and resistance management practices to help control this insect.  While seed traits offer some protection against CRW, they do not get them all, plus they do not target pests like grubs, wireworms and seedcorn maggots, which damage seed and seedlings before the plant is established. Bifenthrin is a critical tool for these other economically damaging pests. <br/><br/>In the case of CRW, there is documented resistance from over-reliance on transgenic Bt traits.Bifenthrin is one of the best, most effective chemistries to add a secondary mode of action in the control of rootworms and other insects. Having a full arsenal of management options for CRW is especially important since there is no other rescue treatment available when the larvae feed on the roots. <br/><br/>Bifenthrin is also an effective complement to seed treatments because, while they offer effective seed protection from insect damage, seed treatments are not intended to protect young plants. Seed treatments are largely neonicotinoids and would not be an effective substitute for bifenthrin should EPA take restrictive action on bifenthrin. I would prefer not to have to use more organophosphate products in my operation because of bifenthrin restrictions.<br/><br/>On soybean plants, foliar applications of bifenthrin protects against bean leaf beetles, stink bugs and soybean aphids. The fast activity of bifenthrin on these insects also helps reduce insect-vectored diseases, which can cause significant financial yield loss. Bifenthrin's broad-spectrum control makes it a vital tool for crop protection. I urge EPA to acknowledge the insecticide's economic and agricultural value in its assessment of bifenthrin.<br/><br/>I respectfully request that no unnecessary label restrictions be placed on bifenthrin that could limit my and other farmers' access to this important pest control tool.

INFO - Title: Comment from Aleks Kosowicz
INFO - Comment: The leak detection and repair proposal from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration will improve safety in our communities, reduce economic losses from leaked gas, and protect our planet by reducing methane emissions that contribute to the climate crisis. PHMSA must act quickly to finalize comprehensive standards for gas pipelines.<br/><br/>Important elements of this proposal include requiring more frequent leak surveys, faster leak repair times, use of more advanced technologies and equipment for detecting leaks, minimizing intentional venting and blowdowns and increasing the quality and availability of data available to the public.<br/><br/>PHMSA should improve the proposal in the following ways. First, operators should be required to find and fix leaks on all gas-gathering pipelines. Right now, there are hundreds of thousands of gathering pipelines that are not subject to minimum maintenance requirements, presenting an environmental and safety risk. The proposal would address some but not all of these pipelines  PHMSA should close this gap and require operators to manage leaks on all gathering lines. <br/><br/>Second, PHMSA should set clear and rigorous definitions for leak detection technology performance, to ensure that operators have clarity regarding which equipment satisfies the advanced methane detection standard that will maximize leak identification. The proposal provides broad discretion to operators in implementing leak detection and repair programs, which could result in confusion and suboptimal outcomes. <br/><br/>Third, PHMSA should adopt clear and strong well integrity standards that include standards for infrastructure and monitoring to prevent leaks as well as leak detection and repair standards for the nations 400 underground natural gas storage facilities and associated pipeline infrastructure.<br/><br/>Finally, I ask that PHMSA not provide an exemption for soon-to-be-replaced pipes. Older pipes are known for leaking more, but the proposal would allow operators to ignore identified gas leaks for as long as five years if the pipe segment is scheduled for replacement. To ensure safety and reduce harmful methane emissions, operators should be required to address known leaks even if the pipeline will eventually be replaced.   <br/><br/>Another piece that could be improved is expanding information reported by pipeline operators. With more data and transparency, we can better mitigate the harm by current pipelines and we can set out a better plan for future actions.<br/><br/>We should seize this opportunity to support cost-effective and common-sense standards that protect both our communities and our climate. This proposal is strong, but I know we can make it stronger to set our country up for success in the years to come.

Other concerns are that it removes the rights of girls to have locker rooms and competition that is based on biological sex, it prioritizes gender identity ideology over actual biology in sports, activities, and programs and it authorizes school personnel to overrule parental authority. This is not good for girls and women, and it is not good for parents. Please speak up to oppose Title IX Rule ED-2021-OCR-0166-0001.

This is incredibly upsetting and I will stand up and fight for my kids.  Our personal values, beliefs, morals and faith are being ignored and pushed aside to allow this political agenda lie that our children can change their gender whenever they want.  To allow boys who "identify" as females to use the girls' bathrooms, locker rooms, participate in female sports is appalling and a violation of our daughters rights and privacy and safety.  Where are their rights? Where are our rights as Christians and believers in God?  There are only 2 genders.  Male and female.  God created each and every one of us perfectly and wonderfully and with a purpose.  This is a rejection of God.  Blatant disregard and disrespect to those of us who's faith is in Jesus Christ and God.<br/><br/>We are forced to accept this indoctrination being pushed on our children.

Please follow the Court-ordered remand for this rulemaking to the fullest extent and write a management rule that will actually protect and recover lobos. Such a rule should have the following components:<br/><br/> Designate the wild U.S. population of Mexican wolves as "essential", which would elevate their conservation status, allow FWS to potentially designate critical habitat, and require other federal agencies to consult with the FWS in order to limit harm to lobos from livestock grazing, ORV recreation, and more on federal lands.<br/><br/> Release more wolves into the wild, particularly by releasing breeding pairs and their pups. It's not enough to release only captive pups into wild wolf dens due to the length of time until the pups mature and breed (if they live long enough). <br/><br/> Prohibit removing any wolves from the wild except in cases of imminent threat to human health or safety. Wolves should be free to roam and be allowed to travel across any geographic boundary, such as I-40.<br/><br/> Eliminate the artificial population cap of just 300-325 wolves.<br/><br/> Protect lobos from poaching. Livestock grazing permittees found guilty of illegally killing or injuring a lobo forfeit their grazing permit. <br/><br/> Reduce wolf-livestock conflicts by proactively engaging and educating ranchers regarding wolf behavior, ecology, and coexistence tactics. Public land grazing permittees must remove or render inedible carcasses that were not killed by wolves. All instances of wolves killing or feeding on livestock, along with corresponding necropsies, must be documented.<br/><br/>Please fulfill FWS's responsibility to protect and recover the Mexican gray wolf.

Youth usage rates of cigarettes are the lowest in a generation.  Adult tobacco consumers 21+ should be allowed to buy menthol cigarettes if they want to.<br/><br/>This proposed ban could create an illegal market outside of all regulatory controls, including effective measures to keep tobacco products away from kids. If this ban takes effect, selling once legal products will suddenly become criminal activity.   History tells us that bans don't work.  Effective regulation and education are better solutions than creating illegal markets and increasing crime.<br/><br/>Please do not ban the sale of menthol cigarettes in the United States.

INFO - Comment: Dear Administrator Brooks-LaSure:<br/>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the CY 2022 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS)/Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) proposed rule.   Regeneron is a leading U.S. biotechnology company that invents life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.  Regeneron is committed to consistently and repeatedly bringing new medicines to patients with serious diseases.  Founded and led for more than 30 years by physician-scientists dedicated to fostering a science-driven, patient-centered mission, Regeneron has developed a unique ability to translate science into medicine consistently which has led to seven FDA-approved treatments and over 20 product candidates in clinical development across multiple therapeutic areas, all of which were homegrown in our laboratories.  Our medicines and pipeline are designed to help patients with conditions such as eye disease, heart disease, allergic and inflammatory diseases, pain, cancer, infectious diseases and rare diseases. Regeneron is accelerating and improving the traditional drug development process through its proprietary VelociSuite technologies and ambitious initiatives such as the Regeneron Genetics Center, one of the largest genetics sequencing efforts in the world.  As a testament to these capabilities, we have a robust partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to develop life-saving treatments, including a therapy authorized by the FDA under Emergency Use Authorization for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections.  As a company that has been listed for five consecutive years in Forbes Most Innovative Companies and listed on the Best Places to Work List, we are passionate about our home-grown science and the patients we serve.<br/><br/>For more than 30 years, Regeneron’s goal has been to harness the power of science to bring new medicines to patients repeatedly.  We have fostered and maintained a long-term focus on bringing innovation to patients by investing our resources back into research and development of new technologies and therapies.  Regeneron also has priced our products responsibly and ethically. Regeneron routinely devotes over 30 percent of our revenue into research and development, and we continue to invest in scientific advances that have fueled innovative solutions to critical health challenges and problems, including the current COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>Our comments focus on CMS’s proposal to provide separate payment in CY 2022 for the device category, drugs, and biologicals with transitional pass-through payment status expiring between December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022.  Among other products, we manufacture Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc), which is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody indicated for Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Libtayo received pass-through payment status under OPPS, effective April 1, 2019 and currently scheduled to expire on March 31, 2022.<br/><br/>As a result of CMS’s proposal to use CY 2019 claims data, rather than CY 2020 claims data, to inform CY 2022 rate setting, CMS is proposing to use its equitable adjustment authority under 1833(t)(2)(E) to provide up to four quarters of separate payment for 27 drugs and biologicals, including Libtayo, and one device category whose pass-through payment status will expire between December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022.  CMS explained its rationale for this policy by stating that it is proposing for 2022 rate setting to use CY 2019 claims data in establishing the CY 2022 OPPS rates and to use cost report data from the same set of cost reports originally used in the final rule for 2021 OPPS rate setting.   CMS explains as follows in the OPPS proposed rule:<br/><br/>[D]ue to the effects of the COVID–19 PHE, we are proposing to generally use CY 2019 claims data instead of CY 2020 claims data in establishing the CY 2022 OPPS rates and to use cost report data from the same set of cost reports originally used in CY 2021 final rule OPPS ratesetting. If our proposal to use CY 2019 data, rather than CY 2020 data, to inform CY 2022 ratesetting, is finalized, we would effectively remove approximately one year of pass-through data collection time for ratesetting purposes. <br/><br/>We agree with CMS’s proposal and its above-stated rationale.  This extension of pass-through status for the products listed in table 33 of the OPPS/ASC proposed rule  will support the intent of pass-through status by allowing for adoption of these new treatments and additional data collection.  We appreciate CMS’s attention to this important payment policy in the context of the pandemic. <br/><br/>We greatly appreciate CMS’s ongoing efforts on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries to ensure access to innovative therapies.  Thank you for considering our comments and please do not hesitate to ask us any further questions.

It would repeal a scientifically sound rule from 2015 prohibiting the use of some of the cruelest hunting tactics against predators on national preserves in Alaska. Such tactics include killing mother bears and cubs at den sites with the aid of artificial light, baiting brown and black bears, killing wolves and coyotes with pups during their denning season, killing swimming caribou or killing caribou from a motorboat, and using dogs to hunt black bears.<p>Allowing the use of brutal hunting tactics on highly vulnerable wildlife, such as denning mothers and cubs, is not only unconscionable, but also unlawful. Congress provided a clear directive to the National Park Service to 'provide for the maintenance of sound populations of, and habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens of Alaska and the Nation' for the 'benefit, use, education, and inspiration of present and future generations' (16 U.S.C. 3101(a)). These extreme hunting methods, which are neither used nor endorsed by the majority of sport hunters, violate this directive.<p>These barbaric, scientifically baseless, and unnecessary tactics decimate predators on public lands and undermine protection of natural diversity solely to boost numbers of prey species and cater to trophy hunters. Predators play a critically important role in an ecosystem, ensuring both diversity and proper ecosystem function. Brutal hunting methods such as baiting, hounding, killing young animals, and killing animals at their den sites should have no place on national preserve lands.<p>The 2015 NPS rule is consistent with federal law and the best available science, was subject to public review and comment, and outlaws only the most extreme hunting tactics in Alaska. I strongly encourage NPS to reject this deeply troubling proposal, and urge the agency to keep the 2015 prohibitions in place.

INFO - Comment: I am writing to urge you to stop the changes to longstanding regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act you recently proposed. These changes would drastically weaken the interagency consultation provision of the Endangered Species Act -- widely considered the most important and effective provision of the Act -- and also undercut the Endangered Species Act's proper role in addressing the impacts of climate change on our nation's most imperiled wildlife. <br/><br/>For 35 years the Endangered Species Act has protected imperiled species from the effects of potentially harmful federal projects. The strength of the Endangered Species Act has been the checks and balances created by interagency consultation between federal agencies that build roads, issue logging permits, and lease oil and gas rights among other projects, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and National Marine Fisheries Services, whose primary responsibility is the conservation of endangered species. <br/><br/>Interagency consultation ensures that federal projects that may impact America's most imperiled wildlife are independently reviewed by federal wildlife experts and project modifications are made where necessary. In the overwhelming majority of consultations federal projects move forward with little or no significant changes.<br/><br/>The regulations you recently proposed would eliminate interagency consultation on thousands of federal projects that pose a risk to endangered and threatened species each year. The changes will almost certainly result in detrimental impacts on endangered and imperiled species and a higher propensity to overlook opportunities to avoid such impacts.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the fact that these are the most significant changes to regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act in more than 20 years, you have provided the public just 30 days in which to submit comments, not the traditional 90, and prevented anyone from sending their comments by email. <br/><br/>I request you set an additional 60 days to allow the public an opportunity to meaningfully comment on these proposed regulations.<br/><br/>I also urge you to not to finalize these regulatory changes. <br/><br/>Thank you.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary McDonough,<br/><br/>I write to comment on the interim final rule to amend the medical regulations for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The changes proposed by this administration clearly violate state sovereignty and federal law, would increase the number of abortions performed by the VA, and threaten the conscience rights of medical professionals who do not wish to participate in abortion.<br/><br/>With this action, the Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking to upend the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health which rightly restored abortion policy to the people and their elected representatives. Nineteen states currently protect life from conception and another 4 protect life when a baby’s heartbeat can be detected. Providing legal cover for abortionists at VA facilities that perform abortions where state law prohibits them is an attempt to use federal force to subvert state laws that protect unborn life. <br/><br/>In addition, this rule violates the Veterans Healthcare Act of 1992, which clearly prohibits the Department of Veterans Affairs from providing abortions, as well as other federal policies which prohibit federal taxpayer funding for abortion.<br/><br/>As the VA’s testimony before Congress admitted, this rule’s ambiguity opens the door for an increase in the number of abortions performed by the VA, as well as the potential violation of different types of state-level pro-life laws. For example, the term “health” is not defined, opening the door for broad interpretation which allows nearly all abortions. The rule provides no gestational age limits for when an abortion may be performed, nor does it explain which types of abortion methods are restricted or allowed. This raises the potential even more for violation of state-level pro-life laws such as gestational age limits, and prohibitions on dismemberment and chemical abortion. <br/><br/>Additionally, this rule stands to threaten the conscience rights of medical professionals who provide care to veterans, as it could require them to participate in abortions despite their objections on conscience or religious freedom grounds. No healthcare professional should ever intentionally end a human life, let alone be forced to do so. <br/><br/>Finally, the hasty and backhanded way this rule was pushed through and implemented goes against established law and proper procedure. A federal agency is allowed to publish an interim final rule in this way, but only if it has “good cause” to do so. This administration has not demonstrated that it had good cause to circumvent regular rulemaking procedures. <br/><br/>For these reasons, I hope you will reconsider implementation of this rule.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Dr. Christian Garcia<br/>63 Greenside Way, Methuen, MA, USA

This workforce is too critical to the independence and dignity of individuals with disabilities and older adults. Something had to be done to stabilize the workforce and address pay standard.<br/><br/>As AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka says the proposed rule is “a long-overdue matter of basic justice for the hundreds of thousands of workers who do the vital work of providing at-home care for our nation’s elderly and disabled citizens.”<br/><br/>I agree with both of these esteemed leaders, it is past time to bring the nation’s nearly 2 million home care workers under the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act’s (FLSA’s) minimum wage, overtime and other provisions.<br/><br/>Please, adopt the new FLSA rule for home care workers.

INFO - Comment: I am writing to respectfully encourage you not to move forward with this proposed rule (RIN 1024-AE38). It would repeal a scientifically sound rule from 2015 prohibiting the use of some of the cruelest hunting tactics against predators on national preserves in Alaska. Such tactics include killing mother bears and cubs at den sites with the aid of artificial light, baiting brown and black bears, killing wolves and coyotes with pups during their denning season, killing swimming caribou or killing caribou from a motorboat, and using dogs to hunt black bears.<p>Allowing the use of brutal hunting tactics on highly vulnerable wildlife, such as denning mothers and cubs, is not only unconscionable, but also unlawful. Congress provided a clear directive to the National Park Service to 'provide for the maintenance of sound populations of, and habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens of Alaska and the Nation' for the 'benefit, use, education, and inspiration of present and future generations' (16 U.S.C. 3101(a)). These extreme hunting methods, which are neither used nor endorsed by the majority of sport hunters, violate this directive.<p>These barbaric, scientifically baseless, and unnecessary tactics decimate predators on public lands and undermine protection of natural diversity solely to boost numbers of prey species and cater to trophy hunters. Predators play a critically important role in an ecosystem, ensuring both diversity and proper ecosystem function. Brutal hunting methods such as baiting, hounding, killing young animals, and killing animals at their den sites should have no place on national preserve lands.<p>The 2015 NPS rule is consistent with federal law and the best available science, was subject to public review and comment, and outlaws only the most extreme hunting tactics in Alaska. I strongly encourage NPS to reject this deeply troubling proposal, and urge the agency to keep the 2015 prohibitions in place.

Radiologic technologists work closely with other health care professionals in providing care for our nation's veterans in all U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs health care facilities in the United States.<br/><br/>As a health care professional, I oppose the addition of Section 17.415(d)(1)(i)(B) in the VA proposal to allow certified nurse practitioners (CNPs) to perform, supervise, and interpret laboratory and imaging studies when providing care for veterans.<br/><br/>All patients deserve the best care possible, especially our nation's veterans who have given so much. Allowing personnel who do not have the specific education, skills and experience required to perform safe, high-quality medical imaging procedures is the wrong approach to address the numerous health care issues affecting veterans.<br/><br/>Only registered radiologic technologists should perform procedures that use ionizing radiation, and only experienced radiologists should interpret medical images. CNPs do not have the formal education, clinical experience or specialized skills required to perform highly technical procedures like conventional radiography and fluoroscopy, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine, vascular-interventional procedures, cardiac-interventional procedures or bone densitometry. In addition, CNP curricula and certification examinations are devoid of any education or testing competencies in the areas of setting technical factors, proper positioning techniques, medical image quality or radiation protection. Without this education and competency testing, the patients, families and other health care providers cannot be guaranteed that the quality and safety of imaging studies performed by a CNP are equal to those studies performed by registered radiologic technologists. Even more, CNPs do not have the focused training to review medical images to properly diagnose injuries and diseases.<br/><br/>In bypassing the health care professionals who are experts in managing radiation dose, patient positioning techniques, equipment protocols and medical imaging physics, the proposal puts veterans at risk for errors, multiple exams and possible radiation overexposure. I insist that "perform, supervise and interpret" be removed from Section 17.415(d)(1)(i)(B) of this proposed regulation.

INFO - Comment: As a member of the American Society of Radiologic Technologists, I respectfully submit public comment to the Office of Management and Budget to consider updating the classification of diagnostic radiologic technologists to professional under 29-2030.  <br/><br/>Radiologic technologists work at the intersection of innovation in medical technology and direct patient care. This requires us to exercise critical thinking daily, not only as part of a larger health care delivery team but also individually when deciding how best to provide care based on each patient’s particular needs. <br/><br/>Radiologic technologists are similar in a broad sense to a variety of other health care workers who are required to exercise critical thinking and independent judgment as part of their daily jobs. The job of the radiologic technologist involves operating imaging equipment to capture images of a patient’s internal body structures and troubleshooting systems to ensure diagnostic-quality images. They collaborate with radiologists, ensuring that diagnostic-quality images are captured through the appropriate imaging modality. For example, a technologist must use certain imaging techniques for a trauma patient to assure safe imaging and accurate diagnosis.  Capturing elbow images that allow for diagnosis on a patient who walks in is quite different than capturing images for a patient with significant trauma. Radiologic technologists work autonomously to use their knowledge, tools and critical thinking skills to capture diagnostic images. If images are not diagnostic, the radiologist may miss a diagnosis. Radiologic technologists must enforce strict radiation protocols throughout their work, and they have a critical role in patient care: providing instructions to patients and ensuring patients are comfortable and safe during procedures.   <br/><br/>The role of the radiologic technologist in the modern health care industry continues to evolve as the demand for improved imaging technology accelerates. This has made radiologic technologists more essential and has required more specialization. Therefore, I believe it appropriate that the SOC occupational definition for radiologic technologists be reconsidered to more accurately reflect the increasingly professional responsibilities of this occupation. Additionally, technologists’ therapy counterparts, radiation therapists, are already classified as professionals, and they ensure a similar level of patient management and critical thinking as radiologic technologists every day. <br/><br/>I urge the OMB to take this opportunity to revise the SOC occupational definitions to provide important updates to the radiologic technologist definition that reflect the growing importance of the profession. I urge the OMB to update definition to more clearly designates the radiologic technologist as a professional. This would more accurately reflect the actual practice of this vital health care role and ensure that this profession is properly characterized. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to present these comments for the OMB’s possible revision of the SOC for 2028.

INFO - Comment: Dear Director Angelle,<br/><br/>I am writing to express strong opposition to the proposed revisions to the Well Control Rule. This rule was one of the only safety regulations implemented in the aftermath of the most devastating oil spill disaster in our nation?s history. Dismantling safety measures like the Well Control Rule while the administration simultaneously seeks a radical expansion of offshore drilling in nearly all federal waters is simply unacceptable. <br/><br/>In 2010, BP?s Deepwater Horizon rig exploded following an exploratory well blowout, which killed 11 crew members and gushed over 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The oil spill continued for 87 days as engineers tried and failed to seal the blowout. Six years later, the Well Control Rule was established to help prevent another BP-like disaster. There are far too few safety standards in place for dirty and dangerous offshore drilling and actively weakening existing safeguards is unimaginable. Weakening this rule would prioritize the profits of oil and gas companies over the safety of our environment and coastal communities. We cannot afford another offshore drilling tragedy.<br/><br/>I strongly oppose this reckless rollback of safety standards for offshore drilling. The administration is putting our marine life and healthy oceans at unnecessary risk by revising a measure that did not go far enough to begin with. I urge you to reject this proposal that would make offshore drilling even more dangerous ? we need much more safety, not less.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Robert Martin III

INFO - Comment: Director of the Office of Sustainable Fisheries Alan Risenhoover 1315 East-West Highway, SSMC 3 Silver Spring, MD 20910    I'm deeply concerned about the impact of your agency's fishery management decisions on ocean ecosystems. I believe that strong environmental review is critical to the health of our oceans. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has made it possible to protect thousands of square miles of deep sea coral formations, save the lives of endangered sea turtles and begin rebuilding of depleted fish populations.   Unfortunately your agency's proposed NEPA rule hands over too much authority to fishery management councils that have a long history of poor management, significantly limits the public's ability to participate in fishery management decisions, and allows fishery managers to make decisions about fishing without fully considering the impacts on marine ecosystems including sea turtles, seals, corals and other precious ocean life.  Please withdraw this flawed NEPA proposal and craft a new one that will ensure protection of our ocean ecosystems. Our oceans are in trouble. I've seen in my own life how decades of mismanagement have degraded the oceans. It's time for our nation's fisheries managers to make better decisions by fully understanding the consequences of fishing on marine ecosystems.   Thank you for your time and consideration.

INFO - Comment: I am writing as a responsible tobacco retailer in Georgia to oppose the proposed ban on licensed retailers selling menthol cigarettes to adults 21 and older.  I am proud of the work we do every day to make sure menthol cigarettes and other tobacco products are sold only to adults 21 and older.  Please do not move forward with this unfair proposal that could harm tobacco retailers across the United States by shifting many of these products to illegal sellers that don't care who they sell to or how they do it.<br/><br/>If implemented, this proposal could hurt retailers and wholesalers in the U.S. and directly impact my bottom line.  This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue; menthol cigarettes alone make up 36% of all cigarette sales in the United States.   Additionally, adult customers who purchase menthol cigarettes also purchase gas, food, and other items that my store depends on.<br/><br/>It makes no sense to end the sale of these products through licensed retail stores like mine.  Bans could shift sales to illegal markets where many consumers can still get them, but without any regulatory protection or underage prevention. Flavor bans create illegal markets that could endanger the public with bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access, crime, arrests, and community conflict.<br/><br/>Underage use of menthol cigarettes is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21 -- not with bans that create illegal markets.  Responsible, licensed retailers like me have worked hard to comply with age-verification requirements, and these efforts are a big reason why underage rates have fallen so low.<br/><br/>I respectfully urge you to reconsider a ban on menthol cigarettes, and instead focus on more positive solutions that respect the role of responsible, legal businesses like mine.  Instead of banning products for adults, the government should be giving adult smokers more information and choices for lower risk tobacco products -- as well as continuing to focus on underage prevention and education.<br/>

I am opposed to 2021R-05 , I’m also opposed to 2021R-08 and both issues, firearms receivers definition changes, AR 15 stabilizer braces and proposed red flag laws are all three unconstitutional under the 2nd amendment. The proposed rule/law changes will not fix any of our countries problems.  Should these issues pass or become law they will only add to our countries problems and fast approaching demise. It sickens me and appalls me that any government agency especially one as high ranking as the ATF would even consider going through with infringing on our fellow citizen’s 2nd  amendment rights in these manners. We as law enforcement officers are bound to support and uphold the constitution for ourselves as well as the general public that we serve and this includes the officers of all the three letter alphabet agencies. There is no justification for stripping everyone’s 2nd amendment rights in any way shape or form.<br/>We all know why and what the issues are within our society. As the leading agency over firearms you should know first hand also. Our issues within our country are as follows. 1st  our criminal justice system as a whole is broken. We as LEO’s arrest violent offenders daily. However we no more that get them booked into a facility and the justice system puts them right back out on the street. Our justice system will have to realize that violent repeat offenders must be removed from society for substantial time to curve the violent crime downward. Obviously a couple days in jail and probation then release doesn’t work. Criminal justice reform is a joke and is only allowing violent criminals to quickly commit further violent crimes against all citizens.<br/>2nd  We all know that if we want to stop the violent crimes involving guns then we need to go straight to the source of the problem. We all including the ATF need to concentrate our efforts on removing the guns from violent criminal offenders, mobs, crime syndicates, gangs and other violent repeat offenders that are unlawfully possessing guns. If our law enforcement community and justice system would concentrate on these areas, society would be a better place for all of us as a whole. Taking guns from law abiding citizens or making it harder for them to keep or obtain firearms is never the answer. IT’S UNCONSTITUTIONAL !<br/>3rd Red flag laws are unconstitutional also. You can’t violate someone’s rights off hear say from another. This mind set of taking someone’s guns and rights without first going through due process is absurd and unconstitutional. Again your proposed rule and law changes are aimed at the wrong part of society and will do nothing to make our society safer. You will only further facilitate the criminals to keep committing violent crime as they don’t care about laws that’s why they are criminals and they will keep being violent criminals until our justice system see’s the errors of its ways with lack of prosecution and endorsing criminal justice reform as its proven it’s not the answer for our country.<br/>As the leading alphabet agency on gun laws and enforcement stop catering to the promoters of tyranny. It’s obvious our government wants to be tyrannical and it’s up to all of us LEO’s to stand up to the tyrannical government and up hold the constitution as a whole as it was written and enforce it as it was intended.<br/>STOP YOUR TYRANNICAL ATTEMPTS ON LAW ABIDING CITIZENS!<br/><br/>Submitted by Kasey Hunter <br/>600 Market Street <br/>Chattanooga TN 37402<br/>

INFO - Comment: The undersigned oppose the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s proposed Direct Final Rule in Docket No. CPSC-2023-0021. As written, the effect of the Commission’s proposed rule would have significant and unnecessary economic impact on the undersigned and all in the air-soft industry. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (AFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612 does apply and requires the Commission to prepare an analysis under 5 U.S.C. 603, 604. Without comment from the industry, the proposed Direct Final Rule would be inappropriate and unacceptable without changes.<br/>The Commission’s stated basis for the Direct Final Rule Process is that the new 16 CFR Part 1272 contains no substantive changes from regulations in effect now for more than 30 years. The reason for the new 16 CFR Part 1272 is that recent federal legislation has transferred oversight and enforcement of the regulation from the Department of Commerce to the Commission. Because the Consumer Product Safety Act requires certain certifications for products subject to regulations enforced by the Commission (see Supplementary Information, Paragraph G in the docket entry), the new, proposed 16 CFR Part 1272 would unnecessarily impact the air-soft industry negatively, substantively and financially.<br/><br/>The subject regulation was enabled by 15 U.S.C. § 5001 which imposes certain marking requirements on “look-alike firearms.” Look-alike firearms include “air-soft guns firing nonmetallic projectiles.” 15 U.S.C. § 5001 (c). While the undersigned have long complied with this statute and 16 CRR Part 1272, there has been no requirement for any general product certifications (GCC). Now, apparently, there would be such a requirement. See Supplementary Information, Paragraph G in the docket entry.<br/><br/>Because the Commission states in the subject docket entry that the Commission would be requiring GCCs for air-soft guns, the undersigned and the industry request an opportunity to comment under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). See generally, 5 U.S.C. 551-559. The undersigned and the industry request that opportunity to address whether GCCs for air-soft guns under 16 CFR Part 1272 is necessary. It is readily apparent upon visual examination whether an air-soft gun complies with 16 CRR Part 1272 marking requirements. GCCs are not necessary.<br/><br/>The undersigned believe the Commission is also required to conduct a flexibility analysis under 5 U.S.C. 603, 504. Many in the industry are small businesses.<br/><br/>The undersigned also state that they and others in the industry are not equipped to provide GCCs for their air-soft products, in the near future, particularly those that would comply with the legal requirements. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 2063 (g). Many of their air-soft products are in transit, in inventory, with distributors, and in retail stores.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the undersigned requests the Commission withdraw the proposed direct final rule. The undersigned appreciate and understand the Commission’s approach and requests the Commission consider excepting air-soft guns from any requirement for GCCs.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.

Clearly this language prohibits confinement, but the USDA has allowed concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) to use screened-in, enclosed "porches" to satisfy the requirement for outdoor access.<br/><br/>The rule sets indoor and outdoor living standards for egg-laying hens and broiler chickens. For one, the proposed indoor standards allow birds to be stacked in multi-tiered aviaries from floor to ceiling allowing as little as one square foot per animal. Further, according to some estimates, the proposed rule would require only 1-2 square feet outdoors for chickens. This is far less than what some CAFOs are already offering their birds. Organic Valley, for example, requires farmers to provide 5 square feet to chickens; European regulations call for 43 square feet per bird. Such a small amount of outdoor space is a disincentive for chickens to leave the buildings they are housed in, confined as they are. Worse still, the proposed rule allows CAFOs to cover half of the outdoor area with concrete or gravel. How does that allow the birds to engage in their "natural behavior" as called for in organic regulations?<br/><br/>This all amounts to fraud. Consumers are willing to pay the premium for organic goods because they do not want to support the conditions on CAFOs, where tens of thousands of animals are confined in small spaces. The USDA has, for years, aided and abetted CAFOs in duping consumers into buying fake organic eggs and poultry. The agency's own estimates tell us that half of all organic eggs come from CAFOs. Because it's cheaper to convert a conventional CAFO to a "certified organic" CAFO than to actually produce chickens organically, farmers doing the right thing and following the spirit of organic rules and regenerative agriculture are being driven out of business.<br/><br/>The USDA has an opportunity to start regaining consumers' trust in the organic label, but it cannot do so with dishonest attempts like this. Please strengthen this rule to support real organic standards rather than allowing the CAFO-dominated status quo to continue.

INFO - Comment: Dear Fish and Wildlife Service,<br/><br/>Thank you for undoing some of the Trump administration’s damage to critical Endangered Species Act regulations. I am heartened by many aspects of your proposed restoration. <br/><br/>However, there are multiple aspects of your proposed rules that are insufficient for the challenges that endangered wildlife are facing.  <br/><br/>First, you must go back to the drawing board and fully restore section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, which governs interagency consultation. For 50 years it's been established that the federal government should not engage in activities that could jeopardize species' survival or destroy habitat they need to survive and recover.  <br/><br/>Specifically, the Biden administration must rescind the addition of “as a whole” to section 402.02. This Trump-era language created an enormous loophole, inconsistent with the intent of the Endangered Species Act itself. The nefarious “as a whole” language is a free pass to destroy critical habitat as long as the total destruction of a species’ entire critical habitat is avoided. This is especially damaging for wide-ranging and migratory species, from piping plover to marbled murrelet, from salmon to lynx. This language also ignores the cumulative impact of different causes of habitat destruction over time. And it goes against the science-based establishment of critical habitat to ensure both the species survival and recovery, instead treating some areas of critical habitat as expendable.   <br/><br/>Additional definition changes from the Trump era that need to be reversed include one that creates unnecessary confusion when examining an agency action that is ongoing, or a continuation of past activities as opposed to something new (“environmental baseline” section 402.02).   <br/><br/>Additionally, you must reverse Trump’s damaging changes in section 424.11(e) that allow plants and animals to be prematurely delisted. It is essential that species recovery meets all science-based standards before removing the backstop of Endangered Species Act protections that have kept so many species alive.  <br/><br/>Each of the many changes to Endangered Species Act regulations made by the Trump administration weakened protections for threatened and endangered species at a time when we must be doing everything in our power to fight the biodiversity crisis and recover species from the brink of extinction. Despite the broad support for restoring and strengthening the rules that implement the Act, you’ve left multiple loopholes from the Trump-era rollbacks in place, which will undoubtedly jeopardize future efforts to protect wildlife and habitat. By failing to fully restore the Endangered Species Act rules, you've left a significant job less than half done. Now is the time to get this right; we have no more time to waste.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>G D Abbott<br/>549 Pattison St NE  Olympia, WA 98506-4960

As recently noted by the Supreme Court in Dobbs, citing previous precedent: "…the 'goal of preventing abortion' does not constitute 'invidiously discriminatory animus' against women." Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 273–274 (1993)<br/><br/>I therefore submit that this NPRM is an extreme and unjustified overreach by the Executive Branch. The Department of Education does not have the authority to unilaterally alter federal law and restrict fundamental rights to free speech and conscience.

INFO - Comment: I am writing to you as a current interventional radiologist and a member of The Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR), a physician association comprised of over 6,100 members representing the majority of practicing interventional radiologists in the United States. I am corresponding to voice my strong opposition to the proposed changes to the "Yttrium-90 Microsphere Brachytherapy Sources and Devices TheraSphere and SIR-Spheres Licensing Guidance" that would eliminate vendor involvement from the Interventional Radiology pathway to Authorized User (AU) status. <br/><br/>The current process, known as Pathway 2, has been in place since the concept evolved that Interventional Radiologists are the natural AU's of these devices. For these procedure, Interventional Radiologists: <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Perform required dosimetry to deliver appropriate activity to the patient <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Oversee and ensure appropriate Yttrium-90 (Y90) device handling and preparation<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Directly administer the therapy to the patient<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Coordinate the longitudinal care of patients following these procedures<br/><br/>Interventional Radiologists are the only Authorized Users capable of performing all four steps above. The existing collaboration between physicians and industry helps ensure safe and comprehensive training in the use of Y90 devices.  <br/><br/>The existing guidelines have been tremendously successful while maintaining impeccable safety. Manufacturer And User facility Device Experience (MAUDE) reports have remained  10/year for both devices since 2013. The majority of the MAUDE reports focus on procedural complication and treatment toxicities seen with all types of hepatic embolization, not specific to the Y90 devices. It seems statistically implausible that reduced vendor involvement will result in a measurable improvement in safety.<br/><br/>Proposed changes to the current arrangement, in which physicians and industry work closely together to ensure the appropriate training of interventional radiologists in the safe use of these devices will make it exceedingly difficult for Interventional Radiologists developing a clinical practice in radioembolization. Without the current direct training provided offsite by the device vendors, physician training will have to be solely performed by direct proctoring. Securing physician proctors is a challenge and can result in the delay in care, impacting cancer outcomes; physicians have limited time and availability away from their own clinical practices. Placing additional responsibilities on physician proctors may also have the untoward effect of limiting access to care, particularly for programs in underserved areas. The unanticipated consequence of the proposed changes is that training Interventional Radiologists in the safe and effective use of these devices will suffer greatly and patient access to care will diminish. <br/><br/>In summary, Interventional Radiologists deliver high quality minimally invasive care via imaging guidance, employing a variety of technologies. Training with other devices, such as aortic stent grafts, spinal augmentation devices, and atherectomy tools frequently involves a combination of vendor and physician collaboration. These relationships are a supplement to core training in hepatic embolization that is accomplished in fellowship. However, fine details regarding all devices may not be included in all programs. The existing NRC guidelines have facilitated training Interventional Radiologists in the safe and effective use of the Y90 devices, benefiting patients, physicians, and the government. There is no evidence of a need for change to the current NRC guidelines.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Sean Tower, MD<br/>Wishon Interventional Specialists<br/>Director, Vascular and Interventional Radiology - Saint Agnes Medical Center, Fresno, CA<br/>

Our government is not intended to have these types of far reaching powers, and our founding fathers recognized that an authoritarian government would be the detriment to the American ideal and civil liberties.

INFO - Comment: I write to oppose this rule that allows the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to perform abortions in violation of both federal and state law.  <br/> <br/>As you know, the VA is an institution intended to care for the men and women who have put their life on the line for our country. The VA plays an important role in providing a variety of benefits, including healthcare, to our veterans and their families.  <br/> <br/>This rule undermines the intended purpose of the VA, using taxpayer dollars to harm preborn children in violation of federal and state laws. Abortion is the purposeful termination of innocent human life. Abortion also harms the women upon whom abortions are done—many of whom may already bear the wounds of war or who may be pressured into abortions by others. <br/><br/>I am concerned that this regulation goes far beyond protecting the lives of pregnant women. It includes a broadly worded “health” exception that opens the door to abortion-on-demand up until the point of birth in virtually any case.  I am also concerned that the rule prohibits the VA from investigating instances where claims of rape or incest are used to justify abortions. <br/><br/>I further note that, in this effort to hijack Veterans Affairs for political purposes, the rule is unlawful because it: <br/> <br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>violates Section 106 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, which has never been repealed by Congress. Section 106 states that “general reproductive health care” is not to include “infertility services, abortions, or pregnancy care . . .” Public Law 102-585, sec. 106;<br/> <br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>violates the Administrative Procedures Act which requires that the public have an opportunity to provide comment on matters of public interest before a rule is effective; and <br/><br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>attempts to supersede the authority of the states to regulate abortion as they see fit. <br/> <br/>The Supreme Court, in its Dobbs decision, noted both that abortion “presents a profound moral issue on which Americans hold sharply conflicting views,” 142 S. Ct. at 2240, and that  <br/> <br/>"the people of the various States may evaluate [their] interests differently. . .Voters in [some] States may wish to impose tight restrictions based on their belief that abortion destroys an “unborn human being.” . . . Our Nation’s historical understanding of ordered liberty does not prevent the people’s elected representatives from deciding how abortion should be regulated. . .. <br/> <br/>[T]he authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives."<br/> <br/>Id. at 2257, 2279 <br/> <br/>This interim final rule as proposed by the VA is an extreme and unjustified overreach by the Executive Branch. The VA does not have the authority to unilaterally alter federal law in order to violate the laws of states that both value and protect innocent human life—whether born or preborn.

This rule would drastically increase the amount of reviews SSA conducts for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries, endangering lives and increasing administrative burden with no financial benefit. The Trump Administration wants to spend $1.8 billion to slash the disability safety net by $2.6 billion.<br/> <br/>Worse still, people with disabilities, including seniors, children, and people with cancer will be hit hardest. This was tried in the 1980s and there was a massive outcry from the public, and both chambers of Congress when over 21,000 people lost their lives due to the cuts made to the social security program. <br/><br/>This is especially important to me as my mother who had a stroke in 2013 followed by another in 2016 which left her with lasting vision, motion, and speaking impairments. That's on top of the chronic heart problems and lupus she also has. When we went to try for SSDI to help get her the treatment she needed she was denied twice. It wasn't until the middle of last year, 2019, that she was accepted. Even when all of her doctor's made extensive notes and we listed every possible thing we could, it wasn't until we got a very expensive lawyer that she was taken seriously. It should not have taken three years and thousands of legal expenses to get her covered. If the proposed rule on changes happen all that work we did to get her coverage for medical treatment she needs to survive could be at risk.<br/><br/>I urge the Social Security Administration to withdraw this proposed rule and instead focus on making sure that people with disabilities and their families have the supports they need.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Chas Lane<br/>Davenport, IA 52803

INFO - Comment: As a small-business operator in Utah, I'm very disappointed to learn that the FDA is considering a ban on licensed retailers selling flavored cigars to adults 21 and older. Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning flavored cigars could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since flavored cigars alone generate $4 to $5 billion in annual retail sales and make up 37% to 47% of popular price large cigars sold in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of flavored cigars could undermine my ability to operate by impacting my revenue. <br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, sales of flavored cigars could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime in many states.    Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of flavored cigars is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.  <br/>

Unfortunately, consumers who want to support higher-welfare farmers cannot rely on "free range," "humanely raised," or similar animal-raising claims, because the FSIS fails to adequately regulate the use of such claims.<br/><br/>When I see the claim "free range," I understand it to mean more than limited access to a barren outdoor area. When I see the claim "humanely raised," I expect it to mean that the animals received significantly better care than the baseline industry standard.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) has investigated the FSIS's label approval process for more than 100 approved labels containing "free range" claims and nearly 100 approved labels containing "humanely raised," "sustainably farmed," or similar claims. Among AWI's findings:<br/><br/>• Although "free range" and "range grown" claims ostensibly require "outdoor access," the FSIS defines that term so broadly that consumers are likely to be misled about what access, specifically, the animals received.<br/><br/>• For "humanely raised" and "sustainably farmed" labels, 85% of applications lacked adequate substantiation.<br/><br/>I am disappointed by these results and FSIS's revisions to its label approval guidelines fail to correct these issues. The agency must require--not merely encourage--producers to obtain third-party certification for animal-raising claims. Crucially, this certification must verify that the level of animal care provided significantly exceeds that of conventional industry standards. And for "free range" claims, the agency must make it clear that limited access to gravel and concrete lots is insufficient.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my request.

INFO - Title: Comment from Fitzgerald , Marian 
INFO - Comment: In 1988, the FDA correctly stated that the law "gives no pre-market review of true homeopathic dilutions [1]." Now, however, I'm very concerned because the Draft Guidance contravenes the law and threatens access to safe, properly manufactured and labeled homeopathic medicines that I rely on as part of my health care.<br/><br/>Therefore, I urge you to adopt a policy that adheres to the law either by A) implementing the regulatory framework offered in a currently pending Citizen Petition submitted in June 2020 by Americans for Homeopathy Choice, a consumer organization whose goals I support, or by B) rescinding the Draft Guidance and working with stakeholders on a policy that does not subvert the regulatory process, which is intended to allow the affected public to have a role in shaping new regulations and have access to the courts to challenge them once adopted.<br/><br/>In your consideration of the Draft Guidance as policy, please be aware of the following key facts:<br/><br/>1. In a letter sent to the FDA in 2021, 25 members of Congress from both the House and Senate (12 Democrats, 13 Republicans) asked "how the FDA intends to utilize and adhere to the framework established by Congress as well as the Agency in order to protect consumers and ensure access to the products that meet homeopathic standards for quality and purity [2]." In its response the FDA never addressed the question posed by the Congressional letter. <br/> <br/>2. The Congressional inquiry highlights that the Draft Guidance is a one-way street. It will result in the removal from the market of safe products used by millions of Americans and limit consumer choice in health care. This is because the FDA has radically reversed its policy by categorizing all homeopathic drug products as "unapproved new drugs'' being "marketed illegally" and subject to pharmaceutical-specific premarket approval requirements or removal from the market at any time without notice [3]. The guidance establishes a de facto regulatory regime to remove homeopathic medicines from the market and fails to outline conditions under which homeopathic medicines may be legally manufactured and marketed. <br/><br/>The FDA's guidance document contravenes the law and the Agency's own approach for over 80 years. The FDA's previous policies reflected the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act's authorization to market homeopathic medicines and its recognition of these medicines in a separate pharmacopeia. Furthermore, the Agency previously excluded homeopathic medicines from the over-the-counter drug review process and also recognized that the law does not require or allow premarket review of homeopathic medicines. No subsequent amendments to the Act have brought homeopathic drugs under its new drug premarket approval requirements. The FDA acknowledged this when it stated that "the 1962 drug amendments left the homeopathic exemption intact [1]."<br/><br/>3. AFHC has submitted several FOIA requests to better understand the FDA's guidance and its claims that products labeled as homeopathic have caused harm. The Agency has not provided evidence substantiating that the alleged harms resulted from genuine homeopathic medicines, which have an unparalleled history of safety. <br/><br/>Congress set forth the Administrative Procedure Act rulemaking guidelines to specifically prevent administrative agencies from impermissibly expanding their control over regulated industries and the constituents they serve. The FDA must find an alternative approach to the Draft Guidance that comports with the law and protects access to safe and genuine homeopathic medicines for the millions of us who rely on them.<br/><br/>[1] Food and Drug Admin., Talk Paper No. T-88-68 (Sept. 15, 1988).<br/>[2] Khanna, Ro et al. Letter to FDA regarding draft guidance on drug products labeled as homeopathic.

Yet these proposed rules would make schools more dangerous for all students. Schools would be allowedand, in many cases, requiredto ignore students who report sexual harassment. In many instances, schools would not be responsible for addressing sexual harassment, even when school employees knew about the harassment. Schools would be required to ignore harassment that happens outside of school activities or off school grounds, even if the victim has to see their harasser(s) in class every day, and would be required to ignore all harassment on school grounds until it becomes so severe that it costs students important learning opportunities. <br/> <br/>And in the rare cases when schools would be required to respond, they would be allowedand sometimes requiredto deny harassment victims due process. If implemented, these rules would allow schools to subject survivors to biased, retraumatizing investigations or mediations that favor named harassers over their victims, and would let schools delay even these sham investigations indefinitely at the expense of the affected students education. <br/><br/>ED should immediately withdraw its current proposal and dedicate its efforts to advancing policies that ensure equal access to education for all students, including students who experience sexual harassment.<br/> <br/>Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the NPRM.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Shemayim Elohim<br/>Seattle, WA 98122

Drilling in these waters poses grave risks to coastal residents and their livelihoods, jeopardizes critical ecosystems, and increases the threat of devastating oil spills, all while driving climate-wrecking carbon pollution and threatening our clean energy future. <br/><br/>Less than a year ago, the federal government finished an exhaustive examination of offshore drilling and concluded that expanding drilling into these unspoiled regions was not supported by the public or the science. This has not changed.  <br/><br/>I am appalled that the Trump Administration would waste federal resources and ignore the public by restarting this process. Intensifying coastal drilling is out of step with our nations transition to clean energy. Its nothing more than another handout to private oil companies, forcing taxpayers to continue subsidizing the fossil fuel industry when the majority of Americans have made clear that they want to protect these public resources. <br/><br/>The public has spoken, and the science is clear.

I call on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to immediately address the overuse of antibiotics on farms that is contributing to this pandemic. <br/><br/>The FDA's concept paper "Potential Approach for Defining Durations of Use for Medically Important Antimicrobial Drugs Intended for Use In or On Feed " acknowledges the problem, but falls fall short of what is needed to protect human and animal health from antibiotic-resistant superbug infections. <br/><br/>The FDA needs to put protecting the public at the forefront of its efforts to address antibiotic use on farms. The FDA should prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in animals that are not sick or injured. FDA should require drug makers to limit the use of antibiotics to under 21 days, consistent with FDA recommendations for new drug approvals. Finally, the FDA must speed up its timeline and make sure these changes are in place by 2025. <br/><br/>The FDA needs to act now and act quickly to make sure that no more people die unnecessarily from antibiotic-resistant superbug infections.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Eleanor Loukota<br/>418 F St  Staunton, VA 24401-2750

INFO - Comment: As a resident of SW Utah and the west, I support the Public Lands Rule and its goal of elevating conservation to equal footing with other uses of our BLM lands (as Congress originally intended under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act [FLPMA] of 1976). While I applaud this vital and overdue course correction, I urge you to strengthen the rule in a number of ways before finalization (see below). <br/><br/>America's public lands offer some of the most readily available solutions for addressing the alarming increase in drought conditions, storm impacts, catastrophic fires, and biodiversity loss across the West. Unfortunately, for more than 40 years the BLM has prioritized resource extraction over other land uses -- to the detriment of wildlife, healthy ecosystems, cultural preservation, and climate resiliency.<br/><br/>It's time to balance the BLM's approach and elevate conservation to its proper standing in order to help sustain the nation's last wild landscapes and the plants, animals, and human communities that rely on them. I'm particularly concerned about the future of Utah's redrock country, where mining, off-road vehicle use, fossil fuel development, and other high-impact activities continually threaten sensitive ecosystems and cultural sites. <br/><br/>While the draft rule is an important step forward, I urge you to strengthen it in the following ways:<br/><br/>- Prioritize the inventory of intact natural landscapes (including lands with wilderness characteristics) at both the land use planning and project development stages and ensure that any proposed development will not degrade such landscapes.<br/><br/>- As directed by FLPMA, prioritize the identification and designation of all eligible areas as Areas of Critical Environmental Concern and manage these areas appropriately.<br/><br/>- Require the BLM to consult with Tribes to ensure that it fully advances opportunities for incorporation of Indigenous Knowledge, respect for Tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, and protection of Tribal cultural sites.<br/><br/>- Protect old and mature forests from logging, vegetation removal projects, wildfire, and the effects of climate change, informed by the best available science and Indigenous knowledge.<br/><br/>I'm grateful for this administration's commitment to conserving and restoring America's public lands. Please strengthen the Public Lands Rule and work swiftly to bring balance to BLM-managed landscapes.

INFO - Comment: Dear Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms,<br/><br/>I am writing in support of the ATF's proposed rule (Docket No ATF 2022R-17), which would dramatically reduce the number of guns sold without a background check.<br/><br/>Our background check system was created to keep firearms out of the hands of individuals who are not allowed to purchase or possess them in the first place. But loopholes in the system—like the ones that allow unlicensed gun sellers to sell guns online and at gun shows without running background checks on their buyers—undermine it.<br/><br/>That’s why ATF’s proposed rule is so important and should be finalized. It will help close loopholes in our background check system that have, for decades, been exploited by bad actors like gun traffickers, straw purchasers, and other prohibited persons, including domestic abusers and convicted felons.<br/><br/>I support the proposed rule because it makes clear that firearms dealing can take place wherever and through whatever medium guns are bought and sold—whether that’s at a gun show or an online marketplace—and that certain conduct, like selling guns of the same or similar kind and type, constitutes firearms dealing. That means that these gun sellers will need to become licensed dealers and, as licensed dealers, run background checks.<br/><br/>The proposed rule won't just expand background checks and strengthen our background check system, but it will also save lives. That’s why I support the proposed rule and why I encourage ATF to finalize it.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Joleen Siebert

INFO - Title: Comment on AQ46-Proposed Rule-Comment Submission
INFO - Comment: I wholeheartedly endorse the proposed rule, 'Veterans Community Care Program,'' and urge its earliest adoption.  For too long Veterans have been forced to endure substandard care at VA facilities.  While much of the care provided is first rate, those times when the VA fails the veteran, it fails spectacularly, and currently, veterans have no alternative but to endure those failures.  This proposed rule will require the VA to meet basic access and quality standards for treating veterans, and where the VA fails to meet those standards, gives veterans the right to go outside the VA for their health care, with the VA still paying for that care.  Specifically, I think the access standards proposed are both reasonable and timely.  If anything, they require the veteran to wait too long for access to VA care. In fact, I encourage the VA to adopt the 14 days standard for access to primary care and behavioral health care immediately, and not step that down from 20 days in 2019 to 14 days in 2020.  Further, I think the 28-day standard for access to specialist care is also too long for a veteran to wait.  However, I believe the 'best medical interest' standard proposed is crucial to the proper operation of this program, and provides a 'safety valve' for the inadequate access standards.  Specifically, while the proposed rule says the health care provider and the veteran will determine if non-VA care is in the best interest of the veteran, other parts of the proposed rule would seem to argue that non-health care provider medical administrators in the VA would also review that 'best medical interest' decision.  I absolutely reject that idea.  The 'best medical interest' decision to access non-VA care MUST be left to the clinician and veteran alone, and not subject to further VA medical administrator review.  Too often under the current system, VA doctors and clinicians prescribe non-VA care, only to be overruled by VA medical administrators who have no contact with the patient.  This must stop.  Thank for the opportunity to comment on this regulation.  Overall, I find this a great proposed rule, and urge it be adopted as soon as possible.

INFO - Comment: As a small-business operator in Missouri, I'm very disappointed to learn that the FDA is considering a ban on licensed retailers selling menthol cigarettes to adults 21 and older. Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning menthol cigarettes could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since menthol cigarettes alone make up 36% of all cigarette sales in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of menthol could undermine my ability to operate by significantly impacting my revenue. Plain and simple: it's misguided and could force small businesses to close.<br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, menthol cigarettes could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime under the laws of all 50 states.  Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of menthol cigarettes is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.<br/>

INFO - Comment: As a Catholic, I support programs that provide assistance to families in need. TANF is an important example of this. I therefore support multiple aspects of the proposed rule to help strengthen TANF.   First, limiting the term “needy” to 200% of the federal poverty line will help ensure that valuable TANF resources go to those most in need. Second, preventing the states’ “maintenance of effort” (MOE) requirement from being offloaded on account of the generosity of private entities will help ensure that states maintain their commitment to provide a safety net for those who are vulnerable. Finally,  improving measures to ensure that state TANF funds are directed toward their statutory purposes will mean more children and families will get the support they need. <br/><br/>However, I am alarmed by the discussion in the proposed rule that appears to target pregnancy resource centers for unfair treatment, and ultimately possible defunding, based on the misconception that pregnancy centers only offer “pregnancy counseling.” Most of them do so much more: they provide meaningful assistance for mothers’ (and fathers’) material, educational, vocational, health, relationship and emotional needs related to pregnancy and parenting, easily fulfilling multiple purposes of TANF. In short, most centers encounter and address the needs of the poor.   <br/><br/> Please take the opportunity in this regulation to protect TANF for people in need.  Do not deviate from that goal by baselessly targeting pregnancy help centers that do so much to serve those very same vulnerable people. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.

As a national park lover, this is especially troubling to me since so many national parks face threats from development on their doorsteps.<br/><br/>Additionally, NEPA has long guaranteed the democratic right of community members like me to directly engage with the planning process of these projects. These proposed revisions limit the ability for communities to offer valuable input that has historically saved taxpayer money and accounted for local expertise. <br/><br/>Finally, sweeping revisions like this deserve more time and public consideration than the given 60 days.

My uses of national forests could be harmed by large logging projects, new roads, pipeline and utility rights of way. The public deserves the chance to raise issues or concerns so that those harms can be avoided. <br/><br/>I am most alarmed that the rule proposes to allow large logging projects and other decisions to happen behind closed doors.

INFO - Comment: Thank you for proposing to expand critical habitat for the Southern Resident killer whales (SRKW) to include marine waters from Monterey Bay in California through Cape Flattery in Washington State. I fully support the proposed critical habitat expansion and urge the government to take expedient action to finalize the proposed rule.<br/><br/>Protecting this full range as critical habitat reflects new and best available science as new sightings and data show that SRKW regularly forage in the coastal waters off Washington, Oregon, and California and is essential to help get the southern resident orcas off the path to extinction and on the way to recovery.<br/><br/>The final rule designating critical habitat identified three essential habitat features essential to the conservation of the SRKW: (1) Water quality to support SRKW growth and development; (2) prey species of sufficient quantity, quality, and availability to support individual growth, reproduction, and development, as well as overall population growth; and (3) passage conditions to allow for migration, resting, and foraging.<br/><br/>However, the proposed rule exempts the Navy's Quinault Range Site off the coast of Washington from being designated as critical habitat due to national security. The Quinault Range Site includes part of two high-use foraging areas, as recognized by NMFS in the Biological Report, and completely bisects the proposed expanded critical habitat area.  From the tagging data, about half the time that K and L pods spend in coastal habitat is in Area 1 (Washington and Northern Oregon inshore habitat). This exemption could impact their foraging ability in an area and season when nutritional stress is a significant concern and impact their ability to migrate up and down the coast. Therefore the exempted area is in conflict with the third essential habitat feature: passage conditions to allow for migration, resting, and foraging.<br/><br/>The proposed rule should include a narrow area sufficient in width between the shoreline and the eastern border of the Quinault Range Site to ensure orca migration along the coast and for foraging for limited prey. <br/><br/>The science also shows that sound from vessels and other sources undermines orcas ability to echolocate to forage for salmon as well as to communicate and navigate. The Washington Governors Orca Recovery Task Force and the ESA Recovery Plan have noted that noise and disturbance are key threats hindering orca recovery and have recommended decreasing, not increasing, military noise.  To sufficiently protect SRKW, NMFS must include sound as a fourth essential feature. Urge them to ensure that it is at least retained as an explicit factor in the prey and passage essential features. <br/><br/>I am grateful that NMFS has engaged and consulted with Tribes to ensure that this rule does not impact Tribal Treaty rights and usual and accustomed fishing areas.<br/><br/>Again, fully support the proposed critical habitat expansion and urge the government to take expedient action to finalize the proposed rule.

INFO - Comment: Animal welfare is important to me. According to numerous polls, it is also important to a majority of consumers who purchase meat and poultry products. Unfortunately, consumers who want to support higher-welfare farmers cannot rely on "free range" or similar claims, because the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service fails to adequately regulate the use of these claims.<br/><br/>When I see the claims "free range" and "pasture raised," I understand them to mean more than just limited access to the outdoors. These animals should have consistent, easy access to range that includes soil, vegetation, and plenty of room to roam, as well as shelter from extreme weather events and protection from predators. I also believe that the FSIS should not allow producers to define these claims themselves.<br/><br/>In 2015, the Animal Welfare Institute investigated the FSIS's label approval process for more than 100 approved labels containing "free range" claims. AWI found that<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>for "free range" and "range grown," the FSIS applied an overly permissive definition that allows consumers to be misled about the quality of the products they are purchasing; and<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>the FSIS is approving some label applications despite little or no evidence for the particular animal production claim being made. <br/><br/>I was disappointed to see these results, and hope that the USDA will work to improve its label approval process. It can do this by strengthening the "outdoor access" requirements for animal products marketed as "free range" and "pasture raised." These similar (though not equivalent) claims represent far more than simple access to the outdoors. The FSIS should establish minimum standards for such claims, making it clear that limited access to gravel and concrete lots is insufficient, and that free access to soil and vegetation throughout the growing season is required.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my request.

INFO - Comment: My name is Fabian Rodriguez. The undersigned opposes the Consumer Product Safety Commission's proposed Direct Final Rule in Docket No. CPSC-2023-0021. As written, the effect of the Commission's proposed rule would have significant and unnecessary economic impact on all in the air-soft industry. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (AFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612 does apply and requires the Commission to prepare an analysis under 5 U.S.C. 603, 604. Without comment from the industry, the proposed Direct Final Rule would be inappropriate and unacceptable without changes.<br/><br/>The Commission's stated basis for the Direct Final Rule Process is that the new 16 CFR Part 1272 contains no substantive changes from regulations in effect now for more than 30 years. The reason for the new 16 CFR Part 1272 is that recent federal legislation has transferred oversight and enforcement of the regulation from the Department of Commerce to the Commission. Because the Consumer Product Safety Act requires certain certifications for products subject to regulations enforced by the Commission (see Supplementary Information, Paragraph G in the docket entry), the new, proposed 16 CFR Part 1272 would unnecessarily impact the air-soft industry negatively, substantively and financially.<br/><br/>The subject regulation was enabled by 15 U.S.C. 5001 which imposes certain marking requirements on "look-alike firearms." Look-alike firearms include "air-soft guns firing nonmetallic projectiles." 15 U.S.C. 5001 (c). While the industry has long complied with this statute and 16 CRR Part 1272, there has been no requirement for any general conformity certifications (GCC). Now, apparently, there would be such a requirement. See Supplementary Information, Paragraph G in the docket entry. Because the Commission states in the subject docket entry that the Commission would be requiring GCCs for air-soft guns, the industry should have an opportunity to comment under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). See generally, 5 U.S.C. 551-559.<br/><br/>I request that opportunity to address whether GCCs for air-soft guns under 16 CFR Part 1272 is necessary. It is readily apparent upon visual examination whether an air-soft gun complies with 16 CRR Part 1272 marking requirements. GCCs are not necessary.<br/><br/>I appreciate and understand the Commission's approach and request the Commission considers excepting air-soft guns from any requirement for GCCs.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration

INFO - Comment: <br/><br/>    Docket No. FDA-2015-N-1765<br/><br/>    General and Plastic Surgery Devices: Restricted Sale, Distribution and Use of Sunlamp Products<br/><br/>    I am submitting this comment in conjunction with material provided by the American Suntanning Association as the operator of a professional indoor tanning facility. While I support FDA's review of regulations to enhance consumer safety, I am concerned that many of these proposals lack the perspective of real-world application that I see on a daily basis.<br/><br/>    Specifically:<br/><br/>    Rule 878.4635(c)(1) Restricting tanning facility usage to those 18 years of age and older.<br/><br/>    I am concerned that FDA is targeting tanning salons with this rule (which, as written, would not apply to sunbeds in non-salon locations that do not charge a fee for tanning). This will increase injury not decrease it.<br/><br/>    It is clear both in the medical literature and in practice any professional salon that, if restricted from using a salon, those who wish to tan would simply take their services to non-salon sunbeds in homes and other businesses that operate un-detected by regulators. They will also attempt to tan more aggressively outdoors. And it is clear that this would lead to an increase in sunburn and injury not a decrease. Consider:<br/><br/>    (1) A 2015 study funded by the National Cancer Institute showed that 41 percent of sunbed use occurs at non-salon locations and that those tanners are more likely to use sunbeds more frequently (Prevalence and Correlates of Indoor Tanning in Non-salon Locations Among a National Sample of Young Women, JAMA Dermatology, June 24, 2015).<br/><br/>    (2) Sunburn and overexposure are much more likely to occur in an unregulated home tanning unit than in a professional salon. The JAMA-Dermatology study referenced in (1) supports that. FDA supplied two references to groups alleging that many sunbed users report sunburns or erythema following sunbed usage. (Stapleton, 2013, Cokkinides, 2009). Neither of those papers differentiated normal reddening from vasodilation (heat) after a tanning session from sunburn, nor whether the subjects visited a professional salon or a sunbed in an unregulated environment.<br/><br/>    (3) Home tanning units are available for a few hundred dollars on Craigslist, Ebay and other secondary outlets. This access has increased, as the 10 percent federal tax on salon UV tanning services imposed in 2010 closed half of all indoor tanning businesses. Much of that equipment ended up in the home market.<br/><br/>    (4) ASA and others have submitted scientific rebuttals demonstrating that the survey studies FDA referenced to justify an under-18 UV ban do not isolate tanning facilities and are not capable by design of implicating non-burning UV exposure as a significant source of risk.<br/><br/>    (5) I have teenage clients who are referred to my tanning salon by their doctors for many reasons. A recent study by the GrassrootsHealth group confirmed that 30% of dermatologists refer patients to tanning salons for cosmetic skin treatments.<br/><br/>    (6) This regulation would eliminate 3-5 percent of my salon's revenue while delivering no measured improvement to public health. There is no evidence this rule will reduce UV exposure opportunity, but will simply divert it to more risky sources.<br/><br/>    The professional tanning community believes a parental consent standard requiring the parent or legal guardian to sign consent in person in a salon is a better alternative to a ban on commercial equipment. Teens should be counseled to prevent sunburn, and that is exactly what we do in a professional salon.<br/><br/>    878.4635(c)(4) Requirement that all prospective users sign a risk acknowledgement certification every 6 months.<br/><br/>    Professional tanning facilities already require clients to sign a consent form prior to using UV tanning equipment. There is no scientific evidence presented by the FDA to show that having clients sign a consent form every six months improves consumer safety. Further, the FDA's economic impact data did not consider the significant burden created from the additional amount of administrative costs that would be incurred by my business.<br/><br/>    Proposed Effective date for these rules is 90 days after publication in the Federal Register.<br/><br/>    Because this proposed regulation would affect 3-5 percent of my salon's revenue, 90 days is not enough notice for my business to recalculate revenue projections. For my clients under age 18 whose families have made plans to utilize our services, this is not enough time for them to alter their plans.<br/><br/>    If this rule is to go into effect, the stakeholders should be given one calendar year to adjust their business models and consumers should be given a calendar year to alter their plans.<br/><br/>

INFO - Comment: I am writing to respectfully encourage you not to move forward with this proposed rule (RIN 1024-AE38). It would repeal a scientifically sound rule from 2015 prohibiting the use of some of the cruelest hunting tactics against predators on national preserves in Alaska. Such tactics include killing mother bears and cubs at den sites with the aid of artificial light, baiting brown and black bears, killing wolves and coyotes with pups during their denning season, killing swimming caribou or killing caribou from a motorboat, and using dogs to hunt black bears.<p>Allowing the use of brutal hunting tactics on highly vulnerable wildlife, such as denning mothers and cubs, is not only unconscionable, but also unlawful. Congress provided a clear directive to the National Park Service to 'provide for the maintenance of sound populations of, and habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens of Alaska and the Nation' for the 'benefit, use, education, and inspiration of present and future generations' (16 U.S.C. 3101(a)). These extreme hunting methods, which are neither used nor endorsed by the majority of sport hunters, violate this directive.<p>These barbaric, scientifically baseless, and unnecessary tactics decimate predators on public lands and undermine protection of natural diversity solely to boost numbers of prey species and cater to trophy hunters. Predators play a critically important role in an ecosystem, ensuring both diversity and proper ecosystem function. Brutal hunting methods such as baiting, hounding, killing young animals, and killing animals at their den sites should have no place on national preserve lands.<p>The 2015 NPS rule is consistent with federal law and the best available science, was subject to public review and comment, and outlaws only the most extreme hunting tactics in Alaska. I strongly encourage NPS to reject this deeply troubling proposal, and urge the agency to keep the 2015 prohibitions in place.

Yet this rule would reintroduce discrimination into the health care setting by rolling back a key non-discrimination provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This rule targets abortion and gender identity specifically, but its harmful provisions would enshrine discrimination in virtually all facets of health care. Abortion is health care  and all of us  no matter who we are deserve health care free from discrimination. HHS should not be emboldening providers to discriminate against patients. Instead, HHS needs to commit to protect individuals health and well-being and seek ways to address the real discrimination that women, LGBTQ people, and others face every day. <br/><br/>[Personalizing this message will add to its impact. Please take the time to add your thoughts or share a personal story about a health care experience youve had that blocked or discouraged you from accessing care.]<br/><br/>Discrimination in the health care setting makes it harder for those who already face multiple barriers to care, including communities of color, LGBTQ individuals, people facing language barriers, and those struggling to make ends meet.<br/><br/>Patients should not have to fear or worry about being turned away or discriminated against because of who they are, who they love, the color of their skin, what they look like, where theyre from, what services theyre seeking, like abortion care, what language they speak, or whether or not they have a disability. <br/><br/>Patients lives across the country are at risk.

INFO - Comment: Dear Fish and Wildlife Service,<br/><br/>Thank you for undoing some of the Trump administration’s damage to critical Endangered Species Act regulations. I am heartened by many aspects of your proposed restoration. <br/><br/>However, there are multiple aspects of your proposed rules that are insufficient for the challenges that endangered wildlife are facing.  <br/><br/>First, you must go back to the drawing board and fully restore section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, which governs interagency consultation. For 50 years it's been established that the federal government should not engage in activities that could jeopardize species' survival or destroy habitat they need to survive and recover.  <br/><br/>Specifically, the Biden administration must rescind the addition of “as a whole” to section 402.02. This Trump-era language created an enormous loophole, inconsistent with the intent of the Endangered Species Act itself. The nefarious “as a whole” language is a free pass to destroy critical habitat as long as the total destruction of a species’ entire critical habitat is avoided. This is especially damaging for wide-ranging and migratory species, from piping plover to marbled murrelet, from salmon to lynx. This language also ignores the cumulative impact of different causes of habitat destruction over time. And it goes against the science-based establishment of critical habitat to ensure both the species survival and recovery, instead treating some areas of critical habitat as expendable.   <br/><br/>Additional definition changes from the Trump era that need to be reversed include one that creates unnecessary confusion when examining an agency action that is ongoing, or a continuation of past activities as opposed to something new (“environmental baseline” section 402.02).   <br/><br/>Additionally, you must reverse Trump’s damaging changes in section 424.11(e) that allow plants and animals to be prematurely delisted. It is essential that species recovery meets all science-based standards before removing the backstop of Endangered Species Act protections that have kept so many species alive.  <br/><br/>Each of the many changes to Endangered Species Act regulations made by the Trump administration weakened protections for threatened and endangered species at a time when we must be doing everything in our power to fight the biodiversity crisis and recover species from the brink of extinction. Despite the broad support for restoring and strengthening the rules that implement the Act, you’ve left multiple loopholes from the Trump-era rollbacks in place, which will undoubtedly jeopardize future efforts to protect wildlife and habitat. By failing to fully restore the Endangered Species Act rules, you've left a significant job less than half done. Now is the time to get this right; we have no more time to waste.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Margaret Murray<br/>995 Nob Hill Ave  Pinole, CA 94564-2438

The scientific evidence that these ice seals are threatened with extinction from rapid sea-ice melt due to global warming is overwhelming. The Arctic sea-ice habitat that these seals depend on for giving birth and rearing their pups is rapidly disappearing. Arctic summer sea-ice could disappear completely by the year 2012.<br/><br/>Our government's failure to curb greenhouse gas pollution is a primary cause of the ice seals' melting habitat. It is not too late to give ice seals back their future, but we must act quickly to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and slow global warming.<br/><br/>For these reasons I request that you propose the listing of the ringed, bearded, and spotted seal, and identify greenhouse gas pollution as the primary threat to their continued existence.<br/><br/>Sincerely,

INFO - Comment: In order for the Biden administration to assure the public that this new U.S.-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) initiative will be a departure from the problematic U.S.-Kenya trade talks initiated in secret during the Trump administration, I urge  U.S. negotiators to prioritize a transparent negotiating process, as well as worker rights, sustainability, racial equity, and consumer safeguards in any proposed U.S.-Kenya STIP. <br/><br/>Thank you for considering my views in four crucial areas: <br/><br/>NEGOTIATING PROCESS<br/>The process for negotiating any U.S.-Kenya STIP must be transparent and participatory. Civil society organizations, Congress and the public must be invited to help formulate U.S. positions and comment on draft U.S. proposals, not just via this public comment period, but throughout the entire course of the negotiations. Specifically, the U.S. must publish draft versions of STIP proposals and solicit public comment upon them prior to tabling them. STIP negotiating rounds should be announced in advance and include public stakeholder engagement and interactions with negotiators from both nations. And proposed texts, related materials, and any consolidated texts must also be quickly published after each negotiating round so that the public can review and comment on the latest proposals while there is still opportunity to make real changes. These measures are necessary not only to ensure STIP outcomes that align with the Biden administration’s goals, but to rebuild public faith in trade policy making after years of backroom deal making.<br/><br/>DIGITAL ECONOMY<br/>At a moment when policymakers are finally beginning to grapple with Big Tech’s outsized power over the economy and society, STIP must not constrain the ability of our government or the Kenyan government to enact new digital governance measures. Specifically, STIP must not be allowed to prioritize corporate interests ahead of labor rights, anti-offshoring measures and the protection of gig economy workers; to help corporations hide the discriminatory effects of source code and algorithms through secrecy provisions; to undermine consumer privacy and data security by prohibiting limits on data flows or rules on the location of computing facilities; to shield firms from corporate accountability via overly broad content liability waivers; or to promote corporate consolidation by banning limits on size and services offered by tech conglomerates or by limiting anti-trust measures in any form. Legitimate trade concerns regarding the digital economy include: ensuring that goods purchased online across borders meet labor, environmental and consumer safety standards, including by lowering de minimis levels; preventing business misclassification so that so-called “digital platforms” involved in transportation, hospitality, healthcare, retail, education and other industries cannot evade labor, consumer and other regulations imposed on “brick-and-mortar” businesses; combating high-tech discrimination by expanding access to source codes and algorithms by governments and civil society; and introducing corporate liability for personal data collected, traded, sold or stolen without consumers’ explicit consent.<br/><br/>LABOR<br/>To prevent the offshoring of good-paying jobs, STIP must include strong, binding labor standards explicitly based on the International Labor Organization (ILO) Conventions and their accompanying jurisprudence. These standards must go beyond those found in past trade agreements, and the United States must assure that the rules are being implemented and respected on the ground before allowing any commercial aspects of a STIP agreement to take effect. Formal protections for joint labor activities across borders, including collective bargaining, must also be established, and resources for ongoing monitoring and robust mechanisms for swift and certain enforcement must also be included.<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENT & CLIMATE<br/>STIP must help advance and not undermine both countries’ efforts to combat catastrophic climate change, by including  a binding “climate peace clause” to ensure that policies either government deems necessary to implement their climate commitments under the Paris Agreement are free from challenge within trade tribunals whether via STIP, the WTO, or any other pact. STIP must likewise require countries to enforce Multilateral Environmental Agreements ratified by the U.S. or most countries in the world, including the Paris Agreement; establish limits on toxic pollution that are on par with U.S. standards; prohibit countries from weakening environmental standards to gain a trade advantage; completely exclude Investor-State Dispute Settlement, “Good Regulatory Practices” rules that can further empower corporations to undermine needed regulation and public safeguards, and other polluter-friendly, deregulatory measures.

INFO - Comment: Restore the Roadless Rule for the Tongass National Forest, Docket #FS-2021-0007-0006    Dear Secretary Tom Vilsack,    I strongly support restoring full Roadless Rule protection to the Tongass National Forest.    The Tongass is America's wildest national forest, with more than 9 million acres of roadless areas. It provides habitat for a wide range of wildlife, including Alexander Archipelago wolves, grizzly bears and salmon. And it's the ancestral homelands of the Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian peoples.    The Tongass stores a vast amount of carbon, with its centuries-old trees serving as a carbon-reserve life raft in this time of climate change. Logging would release most of that carbon into the atmosphere.    Closing the door to clearcutting and bulldozing roads will protect the forest's many values. The Tongass belongs to everyone and shouldn't be sacrificed to the timber industry, which provides a small fraction of the jobs and income in Southeast Alaska compared to tourism and fishing - both of which rely on intact forests to thrive.    Further, I urge you to swiftly implement your "Southeast Alaska Sustainability Strategy" announced last year, which for the Tongass would end large-scale old-growth timber sales on roadless and roaded lands, focusing forest management on restoring lands degraded by logging and roads, as well as on recreation, climate health, wildlife habit, and watershed improvement.    For wildlands, wildlife, people and our future, the Service should restore full Roadless Rule protection to the Tongass and end commercial old-growth and mature forest logging there.    Thank you for this opportunity to comment.    Sincerely,    flynn coleman    -PII-

They capture and sequester carbon, foster biodiversity, supply clean drinking water and bolster wildfire resilience. As the nation faces worsening climate change impacts, these forests can help mitigate damage to our environment and communities.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, our oldest forests face many threats, including climate change-driven stressors such as wildfire and drought as well as logging. The climate resilience rule must take a holistic approach to managing our forests and address all threats. The rule must conserve existing old-growth forests as well as promote the evolution of mature forests to old-growth conditions by drawing on mature forests.<br/><br/>Additionally, it is imperative that the rule build Indigenous knowledge into agency decision-making. I urge the Forest Service to undertake an inclusive public process that involves engagement from Tribes and local communities.<br/><br/>A majority of Americans (61%) say that climate change is affecting their local community. If we want forests to exist for future generations, the Forest Service must take action now to protect them. I urge you to prioritize their protection in the upcoming rulemaking.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Christopher Rogalin<br/>230 Good Hill Rd  Weston, CT 06883-2326<br/>frogs5@optonline.net

INFO - Comment: As a supporter of protecting our nations wildlife, I strongly oppose the Trump administrations proposed changes to weaken wildlife protections. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is our nations most effective law for protecting wildlife in danger of extinction, but the proposed changes to key regulations implementing the ESA would significantly weaken efforts to protect imperiled species and undermine the successes of the ESA in protecting species from extinction.<br/> <br/>The ESA has had success in preventing 99 percent of listed species from extinction and leading many species towards recovery. But these proposals would weaken the role of science-based listings, prevent threatened species from receiving the protections they need, and severely limit habitat protections.<br/><br/>I strongly urge you to withdraw the three proposals (FWS-HQ-ES-2018-0006, FWS-HQ-ES-2018-0007, and FWS-HQ-ES-2018-0009) to dramatically roll back ESA safeguards.

Food prices are constantly rising, which makes it difficult to budget myself and my family for unexpected grocery bills. With a cash loan, I was able to get help to pay for these expenses when I needed it the most!<br/> <br/>A limit on the number of days that I can have a loan would really hurt me because I need these loans.  This rule adds too many restrictions to the loans and I worry that I will not be able to get one in the future as a result.  This is my only option to borrow money so I need these loans to be available.

The DOL knew that this would steal billions of dollars from workers, and hid the information from the public. That is so wrong.<br/><br/>This rule would go against decades of federal and state law and precedent safeguarding tips as the property of the workers who receive them, by allowing employers to take control of their employees tips. The Fair Labor Standards Act was amended in 1974 to clarify that tips are to be retained by the employee except when a valid tip pooling arrangement is in place. In 2011, the DOL issued new regulations that reinforced the FLSA and over 40 years of custom and practice by the DOL and state agencies, affirming that tips are always the property of the employee (29 C.F.R.  531.52).<br/><br/>If adopted, this regulation would force a vulnerable workforce further into poverty, economic instability, and vulnerability to harassment and assault. <br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to withdraw this proposed rule.<br/><br/>Vesna Glavina<br/>vglavina@hotmail.com<br/>1000 University Manor Dr<br/>Fairfield, Iowa 52556

INFO - Comment: As a retired scientist and a concerned citizen, I am disturbed that this proposed NEW rule is based on OLD data, rather than including consideration of recent health impact findings. These new findings cause great concern, including:<br/><br/> new toxicological and exposure studies on mercury and air toxics, as well as new published peer-reviewed economic estimates of the monetized benefits of mercury controls, showing that the EPA underestimated benefits by assuming a threshold for the neurological effects of mercury, calculating no effects from exposures below a reference dose, and failing to account for background mercury exposures (Declaration of James E. Staudt, PH.D. CFA, Sept. 24, 2015, White Stallion Energy Center, et. al., v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, Case No. 12-1100 and consolidated cases [D.C. Cir.]).<br/><br/> new studies that now support quantification of mercury effects on cardiovascular health (See, e.g., Roman HA, Walsh TL, Coull BA, Dewailly , Guallar E, Hattis D, Marin K, Schwartz J, Stern AH, Virtanen JK, Rice G. Evaluation of the cardiovascular effects of methylmercury exposures: current evidence supports development of a dose-response function for regulatory benefits analysis. Environmental Health Perspectives 2011 May;119(5):607-14. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1003012. Epub 2011 Jan 10. Review). <br/><br/>Of importance to consider also, is a new study finding that the monetized benefits of reducing mercury under MATS are $1.1 billion per year economy-wide, as opposed to the EPAs limited estimate of $4-$6 million per year (81 Fed. Reg. at 2444, citing Giang, Amanda, and Noelle E. Selin, 2016. Benefits of Mercury Controls for the United States. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 113 (2): 286-291 [https://www.pnas.org/content/113/2/286]).<br/><br/>In addition, we now know that the EPAs 2011 projections of costs were significantly overestimated. In the 2016 supplemental finding, the EPA referenced a study that found that the control technologies actually deployed by industry to comply with MATS were substantially less expensive and more effective than the EPA had projected, and that the actual annual compliance costs were approximately $2 billion per year, less than one-quarter of the EPAs 2011 projections (81 FR 24432).<br/><br/>I believe that the EPAs reliance on outdated information and refusal to supplement that information with new available credible peer-reviewed studies is not scientifically defensible.

NPS is a private counseling practice that serves all ages of both genders who may have ADHD, struggling with executive functioning at work and at home in Illinois and surrounding states. Myself, and my colleagues believe the classification of CPT Codes 96130-96133 as valuable via telehealth only during the Public Health Emergency (PHE), and their failure to add them to the Medicaid Telehealth List (via Category 1) with permanency will negatively impact the patients I serve.The benefit seen by my patients through the use of neuropsychological testing via telehealth includes: <br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The ability to safely monitor and objectively measure medication efficacy for Schedule II drugs to treat ADHD and related disorders.<br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The Ability to remove arbitrary geographic restrictions on where patients must be located to receive services. <br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The use of neuropsychological testing for medication management has been cleared by the FDA, and provides physicians a safe and validated way to monitor medication efficacy remotely.<br/>•<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>In addition to improved safety measures, it also allows more consistent adherence to HEDIS guidelines for ADHD medication management. <br/>An additional benefit to classification of CPT codes 96130-96133 as Category 1 is physicians improved ability to close the disparity gap between rural and urban communities who are largely affected by neuropsychological disorders. With over 60% of rural Americans living in areas with a shortage of mental health professionals and over 65% of those who do receive mental health care obtain these services from a primary care provider, the need for access to appropriate and specialized mental health services via telehealth is clear.  Additionally, following the PHE there will continue to be a medically fragile population requiring these services for proper evaluation and treatment who would otherwise be underserved. <br/>Failure to support the ability to provide neuropsychological testing services via telehealth through recategorization to Category 1, will also limit necessary innovation in the field to serve a vulnerable population, where untreated psychological disorders can have public health safety risks alongside personal disenfranchisement. <br/>I am requesting the Center For Medicaid Services add CPT Codes 96136-96138 to the Medicaid Telehealth List with permanency.

The FDA's Policy Regarding Certain Food Labeling Requirements During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency ("Temporary Guidance") - drafted to address potential manufacturing supply chain issues -- could easily put consumers at risk who must adhere to a gluten free diet and cause confusion for manufacturers trying to follow the Gluten Free Labeling Rule during the pandemic. <br/><br/>The FDA should make the minor modifications to the end of Section C.2.a (Avoidance Considerations) needed to its Temporary Guidance to include a specific reference to its Gluten Free Labeling Rule that clarifies how manufacturers should proceed in making substitutions involving gluten. <br/><br/>This simple modification would accomplish three important goals: providing clarity to manufacturers; providing assurances to consumers that they can still believe the food labels in which they used to have at least some modicum of trust; allowing U.S. foods to resume their place in international commerce.<br/><br/>The FDA was established over 100 years ago as a federal consumer protection agency. We call on you now to protect gluten free consumers in this turbulent time. Provide not only the guidance, but the requirements needed to ensure that manufacturers accurately inform gluten free consumers with comprehensive food labels.  <br/><br/>Furthermore, I urge you to move swiftly after this urgent health crisis subsides to provide clear guidelines in labeling foods and beverages containing fermented or hydrolyzed ingredients, which the agency has previously wisely acknowledged "are needed to help ensure that individuals with celiac disease are not misled and receive truthful and accurate information with respect to . . . foods labeled as 'gluten-free.'"

INFO - Comment: Roxanne Rothschild,<br/><br/>Dear Ms. Rothschild,<br/><br/>I strongly oppose the National Labor Relations Boards proposed rule on the Standard for Determining Joint-Employer Status.  <br/><br/>The National Labor Relations Act gives employees the right to join together in union and collectively bargain with their employer. However, over the last several decades, corporate practices have eroded this fundamental right. Corporations increasingly rely on contingent and alternative workforce arrangements. These arrangements, and NLRB decisions that have severely limited responsibility for all entities that affect workplace conditions, have allowed corporations to avoid both responsibility for violations of labor law and the bargaining table. Workers are not able to bargain effectively if all entities that meaningfully affect their terms and conditions of employment are not accountable under the law. <br/><br/>In 2015, the NLRB decided to go back to the original interpretation of the law, which is more consistent with the purpose of the NLRA. This interpretation limits the ability of CEOs to dodge their obligations to be at the bargaining table and ensure that large corporations do not profit from labor law abuses while escaping any liability. Unfortunately, corporate lobbyists have convinced a majority of the NLRB members to reverse course and close their eyes to the realities of the 21st century workplace and the methods corporations are using to stop working people from achieving improvements in wages, benefits, and all other essential terms and conditions of employment from all entities affecting them. As a result, the proposed rule encourages large employers to employ workers indirectly through intermediaries to sidestep bargainingat the expense of workers.<br/><br/>I urge the NLRB to stand up for working people, fulfill its mission of encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining

No one should be forced to sacrifice their religious freedom or civil rights in order to qualify for basic government-funded services. <br/><br/>The proposed rule will undermine access to critical services, such as homeless youth programs, sex education programs, food assistance, refugee support programs, substance abuse programs, foster care and adoption services, assistance for trafficked youth, and countless others. HHS is the largest grant-making agency, so this broad rule would potentially cause millions of Americans to lose access to the services they need. <br/><br/>The rule eliminates key religious freedom protections for participants while inviting employment discrimination by the government-funded service providers that are supposed to be serving everyone. <br/><br/>This proposed rule is discriminatory and dangerous.

They do serve a purpose beyond a traditional stock as they allow for operation of a weapon if a disability prevents the use of a traditional stock.  And while some have shouldered braces, the government cannot realistically control how a brace is used.<br/><br/>The rules are unnecessary, vague, and subjective.  The system proposed is also complex, making it very easy to accidentally violate law if the firearm is not registered and a tax paid.  This in itself is a restriction of that person's second amendment right.  Using ambiguous language to define what is a rifle or pistol also makes it far too easy for a citizen's right to be trampled at the whim of a government agent.  Definitions and rules should be simple and straight forward in nature.  <br/><br/>In addition, "intent" cannot be used as a measuring stick to determine if it has been "redesigned".  This has come up before with pistol braces being shouldered as "stocks".  <br/><br/>The ATF, while having law enforcement functions, also serves as an administrative agency, interpreting law in its administrative functions.  Rewriting definitions of weapons, such as "rifles", is a Congressional / legislative duty.  The ATF is overreaching with these proposed rules.<br/><br/>Law enforcement is not seeing those committing crimes using braces to do so.  This proposed rule will only affect law abiding citizens and do absolutely nothing to curb gun violence in our major cities across the United States.  I fail to see what the purpose of these rules are unless they are just to further curb the American right to bear arms.

We are calling on you to urgently create a strong, lasting national rule that protects mature and old-growth trees and forests across federal lands from the threat of logging. Protecting and recovering these natural climate solutions would be a crucial piece of U.S. climate policy.<br/><br/>Safeguarding and expanding carbon-rich forests on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands is one of the most important, cost-effective, and timely approaches to fighting the climate crisis. Mature trees store and continue to absorb large amounts of carbon in addition to providing the public with clean drinking water, habitat for imperiled wildlife, and world-class recreational opportunities. Larger, older trees are also far more fire resistant, and a well-constructed rule would not preclude necessary science-based efforts to address the risk of fire.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, vital mature forests and trees on federal lands are currently threatened by numerous proposed and ongoing logging projects, in spite of President Biden's executive order to conserve them. We need to ensure America's mature and old-growth trees and forests remain in place to mitigate climate change, and to maintain their natural benefits for future generations.

The proposed changes to Title IX will change that by replacing the biological reality of sex with the nebulous idea of gender identity.<br/><br/>Since the transgender movement stormed onto the scene, women and girls have lost records and scholarships to males unfairly competing against them, teachers have been fired for not using preferred pronouns, and 8th graders investigated for sexual harassment for referring to a classmate as “she” instead of “they.”<br/><br/>Families are being destroyed and parents stripped of their parental rights for not agreeing to hormones and permanent body-mutilating surgeries for their minor children who are being sterilized and turned into lifelong medical patients.  Language is mangled to the point where the words “woman” and “mother” are being eliminated, even in the medical profession.<br/><br/>These proposed changes are being put forth without Congressional oversight and will only further ingrain this harmful ideology into society.  <br/>Additionally, for grievances, the decisionmaker can also be the investigator, giving unilateral power to one person.  There is also no punishment for those who make false statements.  These proposals are dangerous for families, dangerous for children, and should be rejected.<br/><br/>https://www.t-nation.com/alpha-life/trans-athletes-the-death-of-womens-sports/<br/><br/>https://adflegal.org/blog/educator-still-waiting-justice-after-being-fired-over-pronouns<br/><br/>https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-pronoun-police-middle-schoolers-sexual-harassment-title-ix-nine-mispronouning-transgender-lgbtqia-free-speech-pronoun-11653337766?st=hlkb2s8mair9fc8&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink<br/><br/>https://www.christianpost.com/voices/yes-trans-surgeries-are-being-done-on-minors-heres-proof.html<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDrhACq3x8k<br/><br/>https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/opinion/nyt-admits-activists-are-erasing-women-from-medical-language-after-promoting-menstruators-and-pregnant-people/ar-AAYh2ZE

INFO - Comment:  ,<br/><br/>To the Department of Labor: <br/><br/>In America today, the current overtime salary threshold of $23,660 per year is below the poverty line for a family of four. We know that a robust economy and shared prosperity depend on policies that increase workers wages and rebuild our middle class.<br/><br/>Sadly, this new proposed rule change does not do enough to increase the wage earning potential of millions of working people. We call on the DOL to reject the current proposed rule change of a $35,308 overtime salary threshold and instead defend the 2016 rule.<br/><br/>In 1975, when the salary threshold was at its peak, the overtime salary threshold was high enough that more than 60 percent of full-time salaried workers were automatically eligible to receive overtime pay. Today that number has shrunk to just 6 percent.<br/><br/>Earning overtime pay has historically been an important factor in how working families support themselves and move into the middle-class.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The 2016 rule change to $47,476, which was unfortunately not defended by the current administration, would have benefited 8.2 million more workers than this proposal.<br/><br/>We call on the Department of Labor to reject the new proposed rule change, which is based on the notion that someone struggling by on $35,000 a year is a highly paid executive who doesnt need or deserve overtime protections. Any discussion of an increase in the overtime salary threshold must begin at no less than a basic national standard of $51,000 in 2020 (the updated value of the 2016 rule), which today would cover approximately 33 percent of full-time salaried workersstill below the 1975 level, but a marked improvement that would increase wages of millions of families.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Charles Lichiello<br/>clichiello@gmail.com<br/>324 Fairview St Lot 91<br/>West Lafayette, Ohio 43845

To underscore this point, page 36 of the proposed rule even says: "Clarifying this issue is needed to deter the increased sale or distribution of unlicensed and unregulated partially complete or unassembled frames or receivers often sold within parts kits that can readily be completed or assembled to a functional state."  <br/> <br/>The definitions being proposed in this rule are unlawful because Congress has not taken any action to regulate home built firearms, firearms braces or the records that must be kept by licensed dealers.  This proposal reeks of agency overreach.   <br/> <br/>Even though the proposed rule lists several firearms by name that had not been invented when most of the current laws and rules were enacted, there is nothing to prevent an inventor from inventing and selling a new type of firearm, frame or even a slide after the proposed rule takes effect which would make at least part of these new rules obsolete.   <br/> <br/>It is the job of Congress to write the laws and federal agencies to enforce them.  This proposed rule appears as illegitimate law-making because it states that it is in some way in response to the manner in which courts have ruled on the AR15 type firearm receiver.  If a change is needed in the law, then it is properly the job of Congress to change the law. It's not the job of a regulatory agency. <br/> <br/>For these reasons, I am respectfully requesting that you do NOT enact these rules.

INFO - Comment: Restore Roadless Rule protections on the Tongass National Forest    Jan 11, 2022    U.S. Forest Service    Dear Service,    I'm writing to request that you fully restore 2001 Roadless Rule    protections on the Tongass National Forest and end large-scale    old-growth logging on the entirety of the national forest. Not only is    this crucial for preserving ancient forests in Alaska, but also for    ensuring the future of the Roadless Rule itself, which has helped    protect the last remnants of fish and wildlife habitat on 58 million    acres of national forests throughout the United States.    With its old-growth forests effectively capturing and storing carbon    dioxide from the atmosphere, the Tongass is one of the America's most    important carbon sinks and a critical tool in the fight against climate    change. Scientists have estimated that this national forest itself    accounts for about 8 percent of the carbon sequestered by all national    forests. Protecting the Tongass from old-growth logging will not only    preserve that capacity, but avoid releasing carbon currently stored in    its trees.    The Tongass is also the ancestral and contemporary homeland of the    Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian peoples, and they have been the driving    force in the effort to protect the forest. Their way of life is    inextricably linked with these lands and waters. They hunt, gather,    fish, and harvest medicines in the Tongass, which their ancestors have    stewarded for more than 10,000 years. Restoring full Roadless Rule    protections is aligned with the position taken by Tribes in Southeast    Alaska and will allow their traditional use of the land to continue.    As part of planning for a future beyond large-scale old-growth logging,    please also make a sustained federal financial investment in the    Southeast Alaska Sustainability Strategy. Operating in full    consultation with Tribal governments and local communities, this    program will invest in Tribal priorities and will help to stoke the    already robust fishing and recreation industries that are currently    driving the region's economy.    Thank you for your time.    Sincerely,    Jeffrey Barile    -PII-

INFO - Comment: As a clinical social worker, I am writing to provide my feedback on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) proposed rule regarding CY 2022 Medicare payments under the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) and other Part B Payment Policies (CMS-1751-P).<br/><br/>I want to thank you for many of the provisions in this proposed rule that will continue urgently needed telehealth flexibilities, including the removal of geographic and originating site restrictions and the ability to use audio-only devices in addition to other, already permissible modalities to deliver services. These have been transformational in ensuring access to mental health services and promoting health equity.<br/><br/>It is imperative that telehealth services be reimbursed at the same rate as in-person services. Please ensure that there is payment parity.<br/><br/>I also welcome being included in the Quality Payment Program. <br/><br/>The proposed provision to require that an in-person, non-telehealth service be furnished by a provider at least once within 6 months before each telehealth service furnished for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of a mental health disorder is problematic. There is no clinical evidence to support, or benefit of, this proposed requirement. Indeed, such a requirement will pose substantial barriers to service for a broad range of clients, especially people with disabilities and others for whom going to an in-person appointment is exceedingly difficult. Millions of Americans have received mental health services for the first time due to the telehealth flexibilities instituted during the pandemic, which has prevented acute exacerbation of mental illness and saved lives. I urge CMS to maintain the current policy under the Public Health Emergency which does not require the in-person visit.  If CMS is forced to establish an interval for subsequent in-person visits, the interval should be at least 12 months. <br/><br/>I also strongly oppose the proposed 3.75% reduction in the conversion factor and the negative impact on our reimbursement rates. Clinical social workers are already reimbursed at only 75% of the psychologist rate, despite billing the exact same codes and providing equivalent services, and despite our extensive education and training.  The rate has not changed since 1989 when we were first able to bill Medicare. The pandemic has laid bare the essential need for more access to the crucially important services our workforce provides. A payment cut poses an additional barrier to our workforce's participation in this federal program. Now more than ever, we need more social workers to provide services, not fewer.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of my input, and for taking steps to ensure that our profession can continue to be an essential mental health provider in Medicare.

Specifically, I think the need to collect labor market data has been overlooked for too long, and it is absolutely vital. Excess control of labor markets is often an effect of unconsidered mergers, which hurts American workers. Additionally, the requirements for information about previous mergers, and investor stakeholders, are exceptionally helpful so that there is full and current knowledge of market trends. Overall, I think these form changes will aid all parties in gaining vital information-- and information helps protect workers, markets, and the economy as a whole. If anything, I think there is room for more information, and I would encourage further changes to ensure US citizens are properly protected. Keep up the essential work!

But by allowing employers and universities to deny women birth control coverage, these rules illegally take that away from women. That's why I urge you to rescind these harmful discriminatory rules immediately.<br/><br/>You admitted not knowing the effect of these rules on individuals who lose birth control coverage. But I can tell you the effect: some women will be unable to afford the most appropriate method of birth control and others won't be able to obtain birth control at all.<br/>Birth control is basic health care - yet we know that before the Affordable Care Act guaranteed insurance coverage and eliminated out-of-pocket costs for birth control, some of the most effective forms of birth control cost as much as $1,000 upfront. And even co-pays as low as $6 kept some women from obtaining birth control.<br/><br/>Every woman's body and the birth-control method are nobody's business but hers, including you, trump, we have the Constitutional right to use and choose our birth-control and it should be included cost-free to all women who need it. NO one, not religious institutions, nor employers have any right to stick their noses into any woman's private lives. Birth-control must be provided for all who need it.<br/>By allowing employers and universities to deprive women of critical birth control coverage, these rules threaten women's health and discriminate against women.<br/><br/>Employers, universities, and insurance companies should not be allowed to discriminate by using their religious or moral beliefs to block access to birth control coverage.

In particular, I don’t believe premium cigar manufacturers should be required to go through a very long and very expensive approval process before any new premium cigar can be sold. I understand manufacturers will have to spend thousands of hours and millions of dollars to complete such an application – so most simply won’t do it. I also understand that, for those who do, it could be a year or more before the application gets decided. This means I won’t have the selection of cigars I enjoy, and won’t have access to any limited edition or seasonally blended cigars. Finally, I don’t see how the FDA can say a “new” cigar is one that was first sold after February 2007.  “New” should mean a cigar I haven’t tried yet, not one I’ve been enjoying for seven years.<br/> <br/>I urge the FDA to recognize that premium cigars are unique in the way they’re made and smoked, and leave them alone.<br/>

However, a Congressional Research Service report recently put out a more accurate estimate that there could be as many as 40,000,000 pistol braces and pistol-braced firearms in common use. <br/> <br/>There are so many braces in circulation because ATF has been issuing interpretive guidance approval letters for such firearm accessories for nearly a decade.  <br/> <br/>ATF cannot reverse its interpretive guidance-banning millions of commonly owned and legally acquired firearms while simultaneously criminalizing millions of Americans overnight-on the whims of a politician following through on campaign promises without the consent or cooperation of the Congress. <br/> <br/>Further, in Gun Owners of America v.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Azar,<br/><br/>I write to comment on the proposed rule addressing Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The previous administrations expansion of the definition of sex in section 1557 of the ACA to include the termination of pregnancy could have tragic repercussions on health care professionals if it were ever implemented. I am glad that this proposed rule will clarify that sex should be defined by its ordinary meaning.<br/><br/>The proposed regulations clarify that Section 1557 does not require health care professionals or entities to cover abortions by resorting the plain meaning of the word sex and enforcing existing conscience protections laws. Without this clarification from HHS, that sex discrimination does not include the termination of pregnancy, the 2016 regulations could be read to require the provision of, and coverage abortion. If interpreted in this way, the availability of federal financial assistance could be conditional on acts that devalue the sanctity of human life. HHS does not have a compelling interest in requiring the provision and coverage of abortion, especially when Congress, has repeatedly protected decisions not to provide or cover abortion.  <br/><br/>The right to exclude abortion coverage from health plans, and the right of health care providers not to provide or refer for abortion, is protected under federal law. It is good for HHS to propose further regulatory provisions to ensure that existing conscience protections are enforced in relation to section 1557. Section 1303 of the ACA as well as the Church, Coats-Snow, Weldon, Hyde and Helms Amendments protect the conscience of health care providers. Further enforcement of these existing conscience provisions as well as a plain interpretation of discrimination on the basis of sex are vital to clearing up any confusion over whether section 1557 can be interpreted to require the performance or coverage of abortion.<br/><br/>Additionally, this change is consistent with the rest of the Trump Administrations policies when it comes to protecting the conscience rights in regards to performing or promoting abortion. On May 21, 2019 the Trump Administration published a final rule to ensure compliance with over 25 current statutes that explicitly protect individuals and entities from being forced to promote or perform abortions. By clarifying that sex is not defined to include termination of pregnancy, this proposed rule brings section 1557 of the ACA into compliance with existing federal policy, that it is not necessary for health care providers to pay for or perform abortions.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr. Daniel Brulinski

INFO - Comment: The guidelines from the CDC regarding use of Opioid Meds for treatment of legitimate painful conditions,  need to be clarified, because Doctors are fearful to prescribe, even after injury or surgery, and certain places like the Cleveland  Clinic,  have gone Opioid free, leaving post-op patients to suffer,  because it is a verified fact, that there have been no effective replacement at this time for pain relief, but the fear of prescribing opioids is inhumanely leaving patients, as well as thousands with painful conditions, left to suffer, because of these CDC guidelines, and the unjust arrest  or seizure of license of Doctors who have prescribed.  Med students are being taught that anyone who takes an Opioid becomes addicted,  when it is fact that many, many people with painful conditions have taken them safely without addiction,  for many years.  DEPENDENCE,  where a med needs to be slowly withdrawn, is not addiction, and if a patient feels his/her quality of life is enhanced with a pain relieving med so it's worth developing dependence, it should be allowed, rather than forcing them to suffer in pain, and risk suicides,  which are  occurring in Veterans and Chronic Pain sufferers,  because of the fear of Opioid prescribers.

INFO - Comment: Dear Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kenneth Marcus,<br/><br/>I am writing in response to the Department of Educations (ED) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM or proposed rules) to express my strong opposition to the proposed rules relating to sexual harassment as published in the Federal Register on November 29, 2018.<br/> <br/>Sexual harassment should never be the end of anyones education. Yet these proposed rules would make schools more dangerous for all students. Schools would be allowedand, in many cases, requiredto ignore students who report sexual harassment. In many instances, schools would not be responsible for addressing sexual harassment, even when school employees knew about the harassment. Schools would be required to ignore harassment that happens outside of school activities or off school grounds, even if the victim has to see their harasser(s) in class every day, and would be required to ignore all harassment on school grounds until it becomes so severe that it costs students important learning opportunities. <br/> <br/>And in the rare cases when schools would be required to respond, they would be allowedand sometimes requiredto deny harassment victims due process. If implemented, these rules would allow schools to subject survivors to biased, retraumatizing investigations or mediations that favor named harassers over their victims, and would let schools delay even these sham investigations indefinitely at the expense of the affected students education. <br/><br/>ED should immediately withdraw its current proposal and dedicate its efforts to advancing policies that ensure equal access to education for all students, including students who experience sexual harassment.<br/> <br/>Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the NPRM.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Adrienne West<br/>Sherman, CT 06784

These policies not only violate the spirit of equality, but also put our daughters in danger.<br/><br/>School districts will likely err on the side of 'inclusion' to avoid losing access to federal funding. However, this short-sighted approach ignores very real and serious risks that come with implementing such policies.<br/><br/>First and foremost, allowing biologically male athletes into girls' athletic programs destroys any hope of fair competition. It puts female athletes at a distinct disadvantage due to physical strength and size variances, which undermines the integrity of school athletics as a whole. <br/><br/>Additionally, it also presents a unique risk  that grown men would be able to use women's locker rooms and showers. This poses significant dangers for female students in terms of their privacy and safety due to potential sexual misconduct or predatory behavior from male students or other adults with access to locker rooms or similar areas at school.<br/><br/>It is unacceptable for our educational institutions to prioritize student inclusivity over student safety. Our children should be able to enjoy a safe learning environment without having their rights or safety compromised by ill-conceived rules designed around political correctness rather than common sense.<br/><br/>Therefore, I urge you to consider both the immediate and long-term effects of such policies on the safety and well-being of our daughters when making your decisions regarding educational policy implementation.

It would repeal a scientifically sound rule from 2015 prohibiting the use of some of the cruelest hunting tactics against predators on national preserves in Alaska. Such tactics include killing mother bears and cubs at den sites with the aid of artificial light, baiting brown and black bears, killing wolves and coyotes with pups during their denning season, killing swimming caribou or killing caribou from a motorboat, and using dogs to hunt black bears.<p>Allowing the use of brutal hunting tactics on highly vulnerable wildlife, such as denning mothers and cubs, is not only unconscionable, but also unlawful. Congress provided a clear directive to the National Park Service to 'provide for the maintenance of sound populations of, and habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens of Alaska and the Nation' for the 'benefit, use, education, and inspiration of present and future generations' (16 U.S.C. 3101(a)). These extreme hunting methods, which are neither used nor endorsed by the majority of sport hunters, violate this directive.<p>These barbaric, scientifically baseless, and unnecessary tactics decimate predators on public lands and undermine protection of natural diversity solely to boost numbers of prey species and cater to trophy hunters. Predators play a critically important role in an ecosystem, ensuring both diversity and proper ecosystem function. Brutal hunting methods such as baiting, hounding, killing young animals, and killing animals at their den sites should have no place on national preserve lands.<p>The 2015 NPS rule is consistent with federal law and the best available science, was subject to public review and comment, and outlaws only the most extreme hunting tactics in Alaska. I strongly encourage NPS to reject this deeply troubling proposal, and urge the agency to keep the 2015 prohibitions in place.

Low-income people see their costs go up more than most people, so shrinking the poverty line will simply define them as non-poor and deny them the help they badly need. The Trump Administration should make a good-faith effort to find accurate measures of poverty and to understand the impact of the changes they propose on children, working people, retirees, women, people with disabilities, and communities of color instead of trying to redefine poverty out of existence. <br/><br/>If the administration implements this shrinkage of the poverty line, rather than treating people humanely, the members of the administration will have shown themselves to be uncaring, selfish, and ultra-manipulative.<br/><br/>Flora Greig <br/>greigs@andrews.edu <br/>2054 E Lemon Creek Rd <br/>Berrien Springs, Michigan 49103<br/><br/> <br/>

Almost all private health plans must cover sterilization and all FDA-approved "contraceptives," including drugs that can cause abortion, as well as "education and counseling" promoting these to women and girls.  This coverage will be imposed "automatically" even on the employees of many religious organizations and their children.

As a dedicated supporter of the policy and its recipients, I strongly encourage DHS to reinforce the proposed rule by ensuring that both deferred action and work authorization remain connected in the policy, which DHS acknowledges to be an effective program to help undocumented immigrants live and work in the only country theyve ever called home.I personally support DACA because my parents are refugees, and I saw firsthand how a safe, supportive community allowed them to flourish and contribute..<br/><br/>In addition to the raw statistics supporting protecting DACA recipients, I personally believe it would be a significant loss for family members, loved ones, communities, classrooms, nurses, farmworkers and so many more if DACA recipients no longer have at least a temporary relief from deportation as well as access to work authorization. No one should have to live with the legal uncertainty of losing protections from deportation or the practical uncertainty of whether one can feed him or herself and family.  <br/><br/>DHS must take steps to improve the proposed rule to better protect  DACA recipients from uncertainty and legal limbo, but as this proposal-- which was published by an administration that maintains it supports undocumented immigrants-- shows, the DACA policy does not resolve the day-to-day limbo experienced by DACA recipients.  Congress must immediately provide permanent relief to the millions of undocumented people who call the U.S. home. Its time for President Biden and Congress to deliver a pathway to citizenship for undocumented youth, farmworkers, and essential workers, as well as those granted Temporary Protected Status.

Bush and President Barack Obama for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and other threatened marine national monuments.  Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America's economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world's fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii's economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii's economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America's leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.

Your own scientists have concluded that the death of even a single reproductive-age female would jeopardize the existence of this species.  <br/><br/>So, any way to mitigate risks to these whales’ survival should be implemented immediately.  This includes mandatory speed limits and other reasonable measures governing vessel traffic within the whales’ habitat:  <br/><br/>** a mandatory 10-knot speed limit; <br/>** no vessel transits at night; <br/>** utilize visual observers and maintain a separation distance of 500 m from Rice's whales; <br/>** use and operate an Automatic Identification System, or notify NMFS of transits through the habitat;  <br/>** and report deviations from these requirements to NMFS. <br/><br/>Based on the latest science showing that these whales are persistently found in waters 100-400 meters deep all the way to the U.S.-Mexico border, these measures are needed not only within the whales’ previously identified “core habitat,” but throughout the Gulf.  Slowing down for Gulf of Mexico whales is a key step and only one part of the protection that is needed. These whales can recover as long as conditions improve, but that all depends on our actions. Unless the Biden administration takes significant conservation actions, the U.S. is likely to cause the first extinction of a great whale species resulting from human activity. We cannot let that happen.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Cathy Marczyk<br/>Highland Mills, NY 10930

I strongly oppose this rule and request that it be rescinded because it discriminates against organizations that believe in the biological definition of “sex” and ultimately leads to harmful reduction in services to American families.<br/><br/>Organizations that receive HHS grants provide invaluable services to so many families in need. Those organizations that receive federal funding through HHS grants should not be forced to accept an expanded definition of “sex” that includes “sexual orientation and gender identity” and could ultimately lead to life-altering actions, including promoting gender transitions of minors.<br/><br/>While there is some action taken in the rule to assist faith-based organizations, some individuals and organizations will have serious concerns with, for instance, using their services intended for a woman be provided to a biological male, despite their being no faith basis for their reasoning. It is completely logical that an organization helping women overcome violence would wish to continue to deter men from using women’s restrooms. <br/><br/>State legislatures too are working hard to protect youth from being cornered into believing they should undergo “transition” procedures. Many states have already adopted legislation prohibiting the harmful practices of so-called “gender affirming care,” including mastectomies on healthy, young women. This rule sidesteps those state legislatures by forcing states to embrace this new definition of “sex” when accepting this block grant funding. <br/><br/>States, non-profits, and organizations seeking to serve the public and protect our nation’s young people should not be excluded from federal funding for their beliefs about human sexuality.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of this comment.

While I understand the need for transparency, I have concerns about the potential impact on everyday consumers.<br/><br/>Firstly, I believe it is important to consider the rise of NFTs. These unique digital assets have gained popularity, and their inclusion in the reporting requirements could create unnecessary burdens for individuals who engage in NFT transactions. It is crucial to strike a balance between oversight and allowing the NFT market to flourish.<br/><br/>Secondly, privacy is a significant concern. Requiring the reporting of every digital asset transaction, including those of average Americans, raises questions about the protection of personal information. It is essential to ensure that privacy rights are respected while still achieving the goal of pursuing tax cheats.<br/><br/>Lastly, the inclusion of stablecoin transactions in the reporting requirements should be carefully considered. Stablecoins play a vital role in the digital asset ecosystem, and subjecting every transaction to reporting could hinder their adoption and functionality.<br/><br/>I urge the IRS to carefully evaluate the potential impact of these rules on NFTs, privacy, and stablecoins. Finding a balanced approach that promotes transparency while safeguarding individual privacy rights is crucial. Thank you for considering these perspectives.

The large increase in disability reviews in this proposal will result in unwarranted denials.  <br/><br/>A similar approach was taken under the Reagan Administration, with such inhumane results that the policy was reversed after a public outcry when its harm became known.  The Reagan Administration terminated benefits of 315,000 people.  Nearly two-thirds of these denials were reversed.  Among those who lost benefits, 21,176 died.  <br/><br/>The Reagan Administration then and the current Administration now assume those denied will go to work, but studies, including research cited in the proposed rule itself, show that only a small minority will have even modest earnings.  At least two-thirds or more will not be able to work because their health impairments are severe.  With the evidence of the aborted Reagan policy and of more recent research showing clearly the harmful consequences of the rule, it is incomprehensible that it is now being put forward.  I strongly urge you to withdraw this proposed rule. <br/><br/>Debbie Schepis<br/>dms763@gmail.com<br/>302 Seaton Avenue<br/>Roselle Park, New Jersey 07204

INFO - Comment: I am appalled that our treasured national parks and monuments, like the Bears Ears National Monument, are up for review at all. Bears Ears is one of our nation's newest monuments -- the American people are very lucky to now call this ancient site covering an expanse of 1.3 million acres a public resource protected for future generations. The monument protects ancient sites that are sacred to the Native American tribes in southern Utah's red-rock country. Utah is greatly enriched by the Bears Ears National Monument. Bears Ears National Monument also provides incredible spaces for outdoor activities-- it is one of best places in the world for rock climbing and bouldering. These public lands need to stay in public hands. No president has EVER attempted to abolish a national monument, and an attack on one park is an attack on all our parks. Secretary Zinke, I am adamantly opposed to any effort to eliminate or diminish protections for Bears Ears or any other national monument, and I urge you to support our public lands and waters and recommend that our current national monuments remain protected.

Instead, this provision restricts access to critical care for an already vulnerable population of women.  I urge withdrawal of this prohibition in the rule.

We are calling on you to urgently create a strong, lasting national rule that protects mature and old-growth trees and forests across federal lands from the threat of logging. Protecting and recovering these natural climate solutions would be a crucial piece of U.S. climate policy.  <br/><br/>Safeguarding and expanding carbon-rich forests on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands is one of the most important, cost-effective, and timely approaches to fighting the climate crisis. Mature trees store and continue to absorb large amounts of carbon in addition to providing the public with clean drinking water, habitat for imperiled wildlife, and world-class recreational opportunities. Larger, older trees are also far more fire resistant, and a well-constructed rule would not preclude necessary, science-based efforts to address the risk of fire.   <br/><br/>Unfortunately, vital mature forests and trees on federal lands are currently threatened by numerous proposed and ongoing logging projects, in spite of President Biden’s executive order to conserve them. We need to ensure America's mature and old-growth trees and forests remain in place to mitigate climate change, and to maintain their natural benefits for future generations. Thank you for your leadership on these important issues.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Devon Crane<br/>Chandler, AZ 85286<br/>devonrae444@gmail.com

Such changes may alter the plant chemistry in ways that include the potential production of toxins or allergens, and other changes that could negatively/adversely affect human and animal health and the environment. <br/><br/>Genetic variations observed in nature are the product of thousands of years of evolution, drift or natural selection. Basing assumptions of equivalence between GMOs and conventional organisms on arguments related to whether they could occur in nature, or the type, number, and size of mutations is not scientifically based and puts public health and the environment at risk. <br/><br/>USDA’s proposal for additional exemptions is irresponsible and only serves the profit motives of the developers of GMOs. The USDA must put food safety and the health of people, animals and the environment first. Do not move forward with the proposed exemptions.

INFO - Comment: I urge the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries to rescind in full the 2019 Trump-era regulations that severely weakened protections for our nation’s most imperiled animals and plants. These changes represented the most significant rollbacks to the Endangered Species Act in the law’s 50-year history and pushed hundreds of species closer to the brink of extinction.  <br/> <br/>It is extremely disappointing that this proposed rule retains a number of harmful provisions governing the responsibility of federal agencies to avoid jeopardizing protected species or adversely modifying their critical habitat. In particular, it retains a definition of “adverse modification” that requires federal actions to affect species’ critical habitat “as a whole” before real habitat protections are put in place. This is especially harmful for species like the northern spotted owl, polar bear or gulf sturgeon that have large critical habitat designations but are still at risk of extinction. The provision ignores the basic fact that the single largest driver of extinction here and around the world is habitat loss and allows the Services to turn a blind eye to the vast majority of actions that harm critical habitat.  <br/> <br/>The proposed rule also retains the Trump-era definition of “environmental baseline,” which lets federal agencies off the hook for past harms to endangered species from things like dam or highway construction by deeming these projects part of the baseline. It absolves the agencies of much responsibility for the damage caused by interrelated actions they facilitate, such as urban growth from highway expansion or increased global warming from emissions related to federal oil and gas leasing.  <br/> <br/>The remaining Trump-era regulations that the agencies are proposing to retain — including the criteria for not prudent determinations for critical habitat — are equally problematic and will continue to put endangered species at greater risk of extinction. Thus, I urge the Services to rescind them in their entirety without exception. <br/> <br/>There are some aspects of the proposed rule that I support. I am grateful that the Biden administration plans to restore the “blanket 4(d) rule,” which will restore protections for threatened species. I also support reinserting the provision that prohibits consideration of economic impacts when deciding to protect species, as well as the provision that removes barriers to designate critical habitat for climate-impacted species.  <br/><br/>However, while the proposed rule restores some pieces of the Endangered Species Act regulations, it is wholly inadequate and represents a huge missed opportunity to make meaningful progress to recover our most vulnerable animals and plants on the 50th anniversary of the Act’s passage.  <br/> <br/>With time running out, we can’t afford more of the status quo. Combating the global wildlife extinction crisis will require the Services to be bolder and more visionary than any other administration in history. For these reasons, I urge the Services to not only rescind the Trump-era rollbacks in their entirety, but to also strengthen the implementation of the Endangered Species Act to avert the extinction crisis and curtail the ongoing loss of biodiversity in the United States and around the world.

INFO - Comment: Dear FWS Staff:<br/><br/>Thank you for considering this comment on the proposed Threatened listing of and critical habitat designation for the Bi-State Greater Sage-Grouse. Protection under the Endangered Species Act is urgently needed for the Bi-State population and its remaining habitat. Due to its small size and severely degraded habitat condition, I believe that Endangered status is warranted rather than the proposed Threatened listing.<br/><br/>The range of the Bi-State Sage-Grouse distinct population segment (DPS) has been reduced by nearly 50 percent, and the remaining habitat is poor. In addition to habitat loss, the estimated population of Bi-State Sage-Grouse has declined by over 90 percent from historic levels, while the number of leks  staging areas for breeding birds  has declined by close to two-thirds. Experts believe the effective population size for the entire Bi-State Sage-Grouse DPS could be as low as 230 and only as high as 770 birds.<br/><br/>The federal Bi-State Sage-Grouse Conservation Action Plan 2017 Progress Report reveals that the number of grouse at lek sites is in decline in most areas. In California, the count declined 21% from 2016 to 2017 in Mono County and was down 31% in the Bodie Hills. In Nevada, the population was down 2% at lek sites overall and fell 19% at Mount Grant. Only Nevadas Desert Creek population showed an uptick (5.5%). <br/><br/>These declines are particularly worrisome considering the cyclical nature of grouse populations. Based on historical population trends, the Bi-State population was due for a significant uptick. Instead, it appears the overall downward trend continues. Given the grouses low population, along with the risks of drought and habitat degradation, I believe the strongest level of protection is warranted.<br/>I<br/>m also concerned about the proposed 4d rule that would accompany the Bi-State populations listing as Threatened. The Bi-State area is already heavily impacted by roads, power lines, and fences in addition to cell towers and waste dumps. The proposed 4d rule is very broad, and its acceptance of grazing in areas occupied by sage-grouse may result in nest destruction or abandonment. Grazing is inappropriate in areas where this dwindling grouse population hangs on to survival.  <br/><br/>For all of these reasons, I ask that you list the Bi-State Greater Sage-Grouse as Endangered. Thank you for time and consideration of this matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>[Your Name]

We believe that strong environmental review is critical to the health of our oceans. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has made it possible to protect thousands of square miles of deep sea coral formations, save the lives of endangered sea turtles and begin rebuilding of depleted fish populations.   Unfortunately your agency's proposed NEPA rule hands over too much authority to fishery management councils that have a long history of poor management, significantly limits the public's ability to participate in fishery management decisions, and allows fishery managers to make decisions about fishing without fully considering the impacts on marine ecosystems including sea turtles, seals, corals and other precious ocean life.  Please withdraw this flawed NEPA proposal and craft a new one that will ensure protection of our ocean ecosystems. Our oceans are in trouble. We've seen in our own life how decades of mismanagement have degraded the oceans. It's time for our nation's fisheries managers to make better decisions by fully understanding the consequences of fishing on marine ecosystems.   Thank you for your time and consideration.

I appreciate that the proposal provides a clear definition of an intact landscape which will lead to better planning in future decisions. The proposal should also lead BLM to actively designate areas where development is restricted or prohibited including Areas of Critical Environmental Concern and Wilderness Study Areas.<br/><br/>The BLM must be an agency of conservation action and resilience if we are going to maintain natural ecosystems and cultural landscapes across the country.

The previous administrations expansion of the definition of sex in this section to include gender identity could have tragic repercussions if it were ever implemented.  I am glad to see you clarifying that sex should be defined by its ordinary meaning.<br/><br/>Though it supports the ideology of gender identity, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) understands the binary nature of sex and the need for the distinction. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) the APA defines sex as the Biological indication of male and female (understood in the context of reproductive capacity), such as sex chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, and nonambiguous internal and external genitalia.<br/><br/>If doctors and scientists treated patients without considering their biological makeup patient outcomes would suffer. Just recently, a woman lost her baby because she presented to the hospital as male and her symptoms werent properly diagnosed.<br/><br/>Additionally, this change is consistent with the rest of the Trump Administration and Congressional interpretation.  In October of 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a memo to all United States Attorneys and heads of department components regarding employment sex discrimination cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  This memo states that "Sex is ordinarily defined to mean biologically male or female. . . . . Congress has confirmed this ordinary meaning [] in several other statutes[.] Congress has repeatedly declined to enact legislation to include gender identity in the definition of sex in various areas of nondiscrimination law and any such change should be the prerogative of Congress, not the agencies.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Judith Newman

INFO - Comment: As a small-business operator in Indiana, I'm very disappointed to learn that the FDA is considering a ban on licensed retailers selling flavored cigars to adults 21 and older. Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning flavored cigars could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since flavored cigars alone generate $4 to $5 billion in annual retail sales and make up 37% to 47% of popular price large cigars sold in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of flavored cigars could undermine my ability to operate by impacting my revenue. <br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, sales of flavored cigars could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime in many states.    Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of flavored cigars is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.  <br/>

INFO - Title: Comment from Kilbourn, Dorsey
INFO - Comment: I am writing as a consumer of imported and domestic wines that is concerned with the multiple rounds of tariffs that are being imposed on wine from the European Union (“EU”).  There is a pair of disputes pending at the office of the United States Trade Representative: Docket No. USTR-2019-0009: Determination and Request for Comment Concerning Action Pursuant to Section 301: France’s Digital Services Tax and Docket No. USTR2019-0003: Enforcement of US WTO Rights in Large Aircraft Dispute.<br/><br/>The specifics are below, but here’s the deal… these proposed tariffs are meant to fight a trade war that’s going to benefit big companies like Boeing and Apple and Amazon. But as proposed, they’re going to do so by punishing other small family-owned AMERICAN businesses and their employees… while also making me pay A LOT more for wine.<br/><br/>Most of the wine importers and distributors that sell to the wine shops and restaurants that sell it to me – they’re small- and medium-sized family businesses. They rely on diverse portfolios of wines – including European – to be profitable. And because of the three-tier system that’s been in place since prohibition, they’re all very restricted in what they can sell and how they can sell it. The legally mandated three-tier system by which imported wine is sold to American consumers makes these tariffs an inefficient, ineffective and highly damaging to American companies.<br/><br/>If they close up shop, it won’t just be a matter of me not getting to drink wines I love, it will be lost jobs and local tax revenue. Meanwhile, the Europeans will just sell their bottles to other markets like China and Japan that are increasingly thirsty of good wine.<br/><br/>Time is of the essence: The comment period for The Digital Services Tax dispute closes on January 14. The Large Aircraft Dispute’s comment period ends on January 13. The proposed tariffs could go into effect soon after. New tariffs in these disputes will kill jobs and destroy small businesses in your district.<br/><br/>So I am requesting that you immediately submit a public request to the United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer asking:<br/><br/>That the current tariffs of 25% on wine put in place on October 18th, 2019 be carouselled off<br/>That wine and spirits be removed from the proposed tariffs and replaced by alternative goods that do not cause disproportionate harm to small- and medium-sized American businesses<br/>Or failing the above, that the USTR call another hearing on the matter of Docket No. USTR-2019-0003 so that members of the wine industry have an opportunity to be heard.<br/>Thank you for your review of this request.

INFO - Comment: Im a member of the League of Conservation Voters  and Im urging you to prevent new offshore drilling leases.  <br/><br/>We are counting on President Biden to seize the historic opportunity to lead the way to an equitable and just clean energy future by finalizing an offshore drilling plan that removes the lease sales in this draft plan and ultimately offers no new leases.<br/><br/>While families across the country face high gas prices, the oil and gas industry continues to try to exploit Russias unjust invasion of Ukraine by making a call for new drilling that they claim will lower prices. But in reality, offshore drilling leases take years before they produce any oil, so they do nothing to bring down the price of gas at the pump today. <br/><br/>Instead, new offshore drilling leases can lock-in long-term fossil fuel infrastructure thats inconsistent with our efforts to solve climate change and pose huge risks to the health of communities, workers, and wildlife. We must put in policies today that will help limit the warming of the earth for decades to come and center frontline and coastal communities who already bear the brunt of climate change burdens. <br/><br/>The climate bill recently signed into law was historic, but it was also a compromise that included troubling provisions seeking to advance oil and gas drilling on public lands and waters. The fact is, there should be no new oil and gas leasing. Thats why Im calling on the Department of Interior to use every tool available to end new oil and gas lease sales, <br/><br/>We will continue to fight to ensure there is no new leasing in the final Five Year Plan in line with what science and justice require.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Azar,<br/><br/>I write to comment on the proposed rule addressing Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The previous administrations expansion of the definition of sex in section 1557 of the ACA to include the termination of pregnancy could have tragic repercussions on health care professionals if it were ever implemented. I am glad that this proposed rule will clarify that sex should be defined by its ordinary meaning.<br/><br/>The proposed regulations clarify that Section 1557 does not require health care professionals or entities to cover abortions by resorting the plain meaning of the word sex and enforcing existing conscience protections laws. Without this clarification from HHS, that sex discrimination does not include the termination of pregnancy, the 2016 regulations could be read to require the provision of, and coverage abortion. If interpreted in this way, the availability of federal financial assistance could be conditional on acts that devalue the sanctity of human life. HHS does not have a compelling interest in requiring the provision and coverage of abortion, especially when Congress, has repeatedly protected decisions not to provide or cover abortion.  <br/><br/>The right to exclude abortion coverage from health plans, and the right of health care providers not to provide or refer for abortion, is protected under federal law. It is good for HHS to propose further regulatory provisions to ensure that existing conscience protections are enforced in relation to section 1557. Section 1303 of the ACA as well as the Church, Coats-Snow, Weldon, Hyde and Helms Amendments protect the conscience of health care providers. Further enforcement of these existing conscience provisions as well as a plain interpretation of discrimination on the basis of sex are vital to clearing up any confusion over whether section 1557 can be interpreted to require the performance or coverage of abortion.<br/><br/>Additionally, this change is consistent with the rest of the Trump Administrations policies when it comes to protecting the conscience rights in regards to performing or promoting abortion. On May 21, 2019 the Trump Administration published a final rule to ensure compliance with over 25 current statutes that explicitly protect individuals and entities from being forced to promote or perform abortions. By clarifying that sex is not defined to include termination of pregnancy, this proposed rule brings section 1557 of the ACA into compliance with existing federal policy, that it is not necessary for health care providers to pay for or perform abortions.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr. Ron Butler

INFO - Comment: Dear Chair Mary Neumayr,<br/><br/>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is a critical law that has helped local communities protect themselves and their environment from dangerous, rushed, and poorly planned federal projects for more than 45 years. NEPA and its implementing procedures provide a strong foundation for informed, science-based decisionmaking.<br/><br/>NEPA is also an essential tool in the fight against environmental racism. NEPA promotes environmental justice by requiring federal agencies to include study and disclosure of a proposed project's potential environmental, economic, and public health impacts on low-income, minority, and rural communities. It also provides opportunities for meaningful input from those affected communities.<br/><br/>I urge the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to abandon this rulemaking process altogether. I also oppose any other changes to NEPA's implementing procedures that would in any way restrict public input, limit consideration of project alternatives, establish hard deadlines for project approval, or narrow or eliminate federal agencies' obligations to consider a project's climate impacts.<br/><br/>NEPA is democracy in action - it is one of the only laws that allows the public to provide input in decisions that affect the health and safety of their communities. I strongly encourage CEQ to protect NEPA as it currently stands.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms. Nina Warren<br/>Manhattan, KS 66502<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Nina Warren<br/>Manhattan, KS 66502

INFO - Comment: Alexander Acosta,<br/><br/>Back in 1975, President Gerald Fords Labor Department set the salary level for overtime exemption at the equivalent of about $58,000 in todays dollarshigh enough to cover more than 50 percent of full-time salaried workers. The Obama-era rule set it at $47,476high enough to cover about 34 percent of full-time salaried employees but lower than the level that it was in the 1970s. Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people. The whole point of having national standards is to ensure decent basic standards for all workers. The updated overtime standard is already linked to the lowest-wage Census region. Workers rights and wages should not be undercut even further by weakening the salary threshold.<br/><br/>annie belt<br/>annieb58@hotmail.com<br/>890 Pacific Ave.<br/>San Jose, California 95126

INFO - Comment: Dear Acting Secretary Julie Su,<br/><br/>I appreciate and support the efforts of the Department of Labor to expand overtime protections to more workers across the country. This effort will help millions of workers, including education support professionals, making less than $55,068 per year. While raising the overtime salary threshold is a massive step forward, teachers deserve these same wage protections. The current Fair Labor Standards Act regulations unfairly exclude them from wage protections, and the proposed rule wouldn’t change that exclusion. Under the proposal, teachers are exempt from overtime even if they are paid below the FLSA salary threshold. The only other professions treated similarly are doctors and lawyers, and it makes no sense to treat teachers the same as these highly compensated professionals.  <br/><br/>While I support the Department of Labor’s efforts to protect more workers, the department must take steps to protect teachers earning less than $55,068 per year. Without changes to how the FLSA’s regulations treat teachers, the wage penalty teachers experience—the disconnect between what teachers earn in comparison to similarly educated professionals—will continue to grow.  The Department of Labor has the chance to create an equitable work environment by providing wage protections for teachers.  <br/><br/>Young teachers, teachers of color, women, and higher education professionals (contingent or adjuncts) in particular would benefit from eliminating the teacher exclusion regulations. Providing wage protections to these groups would not only help achieve equity; it would also help ease the teacher shortage by attracting more people to the profession. <br/><br/>The Department of Labor’s efforts to grant more workers overtime protections are a major step in the right direction. However, the department can and should do more to support all workers.  I urge the Department of Labor to issue a proposed regulation rescinding the teacher exclusion so that teachers whose salaries fall below the threshold can earn the overtime pay they deserve.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms Paula Phenneger<br/>634 Reisinger Ave  Wrightsville, PA 17368-9188<br/>Paulaphenneger@gmail.com

INFO - Comment: Scientists estimate that hundreds of thousands of wolves once inhabited the lower 48 states. Decades of human persecution, however, brought them to the brink of extinction. Thanks to the Endangered Species Act, wolf populations are now making a modest recovery  but they do still remain functionally extinct in the vast majority of places where they used to live. Furthermore, wolves face an awful plight in states where theyve already lost federal protections. In Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, nearly 3,500 wolves have already been killed in just eight years.<br/><br/>The wild ancestor of the domestic dogs we know and love today, wolves are icons of Americas remaining wild landscapes. Their presence is vital to maintaining the balance of their native habitat. Wolves regulate the behavior of elk and deer populations, keeping herds from overgrazing. This allows trees to grow in greater abundance, grasses to grow taller, and animals that rely on them to flourish, strengthening the resilience of the entire ecosystem.<br/><br/>Bald eagles were afforded federal protections for long enough to allow their successful recovery. Likewise, wolves need to retain their own federal protections if they are to return to the remaining wild places that are suitable for them and that still need them. <br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments, and I urge you to cancel the plans to strip federal protections from wolves across the lower 48 states.

INFO - Comment: As a clinician, I urge CMS to ensure the final Physician Fee Schedule for 2023 strengthens access to psychological services and gives behavioral health professionals the tools they need to meet the mental health needs of diverse communities. Many of the issues raised in this year’s Physician Fee Schedule have serious implications for equity in access to behavioral health care. Through my comments, I urge CMS to adopt policies with the overall goal of facilitating access to mental and behavioral health treatment in underserved communities to the maximum extent possible. <br/><br/>Strengthen the Practice of Psychology<br/> BHI Codes <br/>I support CMS’ proposed coding and payment for General Behavioral Health Integration (BHI) to recognize psychologists’ role in integrated care. I appreciate CMS’ support for multiple evidence-based models of integrated care, as it allows psychologists the flexibility required to support the behavioral health needs of the broader community.<br/> Medicare Potentially Underutilized Services<br/>I appreciate CMS’ request for comments on potentially underutilized services, as several of the services CMS identified are performed by psychologists. I recommend CMS create additional Cognitive Assessment & Care codes without the medication reconciliation service because medication management is outside the scope of a psychologist’s license in many states. Additionally, I recommend CMS allow reimbursement for Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Obesity services provided by psychologists. <br/> Chronic Pain Management and Treatment (CPM) Bundles<br/>I ask CMS to create additional bundled pain management codes that do not include medication management. I am concerned that psychologists would be excluded from this new bundled service because in most states medication management is outside the scope of a psychologist’s license. Psychologists play a critical role in implementing non-pharmacological approaches to treatment, which may be safer or more effective for some patients, as well as team-based comprehensive pain management.<br/> Telehealth<br/>Many patients in rural and underserved areas are now able to access mental health services, often for the first time. Additionally, many patients prefer utilizing telehealth for a variety of reasons. Reverting to the non-facility rate for telehealth services after the end of the COVID public health emergency will lead practitioners to offer telehealth less frequently or to restrict the number of Medicare beneficiaries they treat using telehealth.<br/><br/>Expand Psychology Training and Workforce Development<br/> Supervision by Psychologists <br/>I applaud CMS’ Proposed Revisions to the “Incident to” Physicians’ Services Regulation for Behavioral Health Services to allow for reimbursement for Physicians and Non-Physician Providers (NPPs), which include psychologists, who supervise these practitioners in their everyday practice. This will help expand access to and coordination of mental health services in rural and underserved areas where masters’-level practitioners represent a substantial segment of the mental health providers in the area.<br/> Advanced Psychology Trainee Services <br/>I urge CMS to allow for Medicare reimbursement of services provided by advanced psychology trainees under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. Although psychology interns receive extensive clinical experience prior to their internship, services provided by trainees under the supervision of a licensed psychologist are not reimbursable under Medicare. Without Medicare reimbursement of services provided by trainees, training programs lack a steady source of funding. <br/><br/>Support the Psychological Research-to-Practice Pipeline<br/> Caregiving Behavior Management Training<br/>I ask CMS to reconsider its position on the caregiver behavior management training codes. There is extensive empirical support for caregiver behavior management training and it is the gold standard treatment approach for several health behavior issues. Although the patient is not present when this training is provided, these codes have many benefits for the patient, including a reduction in disruptive and problematic behaviors for children with ADHD, improved weight management for individuals with obesity, and better management of patients with dementia.<br/> Digital Therapeutics<br/>I urge CMS to accept APA’s proposal that would establish a new set of reimbursement codes for digital therapeutics—one for purchase of the device, one for patient education about the device, and two for ongoing management of the service furnished through the device.  Unlike the RTM codes, this structure reimburses for an active therapeutic intervention, as opposed to passively monitoring a patient’s condition. A new set of reimbursement codes as outlined above will have a positive impact on access to treatment amongst patients who have limited access to traditional office-based treatment or who prefer the use of digital devices over a face-to-face visit.

INFO - Comment: As healthcare providers, patient advocates, and innovators, we appreciate the opportunity to provide detailed responses, including research and data, in support of the repeal of the Medicare Anti-kickback Safe Harbor. We thank Department of Health and Human Services for allowing comments that promote competition and market transparency, protect the interests of American workers, businesses, and consumers, and investigate conduct potentially harmful to competition.<br/><br/>The anticompetitive behaviors of Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) were facilitated by the safe harbors that provide GPOs protection from the anti-kickback statutes. The GPO safe harbor should be eliminated. The repeal will eliminate the ability of GPOs to hide behind the Safe Harbor and will increase quality healthcare access and choice, lower costs, and increase competition and innovation in the hospital supply chain.<br/><br/>GPOs IMPEDE PATIENT SAFETY<br/><br/>The Safe Harbor has unintentionally created a system where purchasing agents, and not clinicians, typically decide which drugs, medical devices and supplies physicians can use for their patients-decisions that are based largely on how much kickback revenue these products can generate for the GPOs.<br/><br/>The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the dangers of anticompetitive GPO contracting: patients and providers were unable to gain access to the lifesaving technology needed to combat the virus because the GPOs would not allow it.<br/><br/>GPOs INCREASE MEDICARE AND TAXPAYER EXPENSES<br/><br/>Group purchasing through GPO membership was originally permitted because it was falsely believed that GPOs would reduce the cost of care by combining purchasing power among hospitals. Payments from manufacturers to GPOs have inflated health care costs up to an estimated $37.5 billion annually, including an estimated $17.3 billion in government payments for Medicare and Medicaid.<br/><br/>In two separate reports, the HHS OIG discovered that the major GPOs collected administrative fee revenue of $1.8 billion for the period reviewed of that amount, $1.3 billion represented net revenue in excess of operating costs. The report concluded that GPOs may not fully account for net revenue distributions on Medicare cost reports or distribute all of its administrative fees to its member hospitals to be offset on the respective hospitals' cost reports.<br/><br/>Subsequently, CMS issued updated guidance specifying that these distributions must be properly reported, but it appears that HHS has not reviewed cost reports for this information since then. A repeal would require a clearer understanding of the impact of the GPO funding structure and hospitals potential underreporting of administrative fee revenue.<br/><br/>CONCLUDING THOUGHTS<br/><br/>We stand with our colleagues in support of a repeal of the GPO Safe Harbor protection, and in working to ensure that quality and safe healthcare is available to everyone, and we ask that you provide oversight and support for greater public transparency and accountability efforts involving the contracting mechanisms and funding structures subject to the GPO Safe Harbor.<br/><br/>GPOs have managed to avoid the reporting requirements by inventing new fees or accepting payments which together frequently may amount to twenty percent or more of the total sales price. The sheer scale of the kickbacks required from many GPOs is problematic, as smaller manufacturers may not have the capital or manufacturing capacity necessary to meet GPO demands. If regulatory action is not taken, the current system will continue to enable GPOs to keep prices artificially high, because they only reduce their own revenue if they succeed in reducing prices to their member hospitals.<br/><br/>Resources<br/><br/>Danziger, Paul, Cut Kickbacks to Hospital Group Purchasing Organizations, Not Medicare and Medicaid, October 21, 2011.<br/><br/>Government Accountability Office.

To be truly independent, contraceptive and sterilization coverage should be provided through a separate policy, with a separate enrollment process, a separate insurance card, and a separate payment source, and offered to individuals through a separate communication.  No further involvement should be required of any individual or organization with a religious objection to contraceptive or sterilization coverage.<br/><br/>People should not be "automatically" (or without regard to their religious objections) enrolled in a plan with contraceptive or sterilization coverage. No individual or organization with a religious objection should be required to participate, directly or indirectly, in arranging for or facilitating contraceptive or sterilization coverage.

INFO - Comment: I believe we must keep birth control copay free because its absolutely critical to womens health, equality, and empowerment -- and access to affordable contraception should never depend on who you happen to work for.<br/><br/>Did you know that 62.4 million women across the country benefit from copay-free contraception? The expansion of access to copay-free contraception under the Affordable Care Act saved Americans more than $1.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs in the first year alone and contributed to a decline in unintended pregnancies (which cost American taxpayers $21 billion per year before the expansion of copay-free birth control) to historic lows. Birth control enables women to finish their education, get -- and keep -- good jobs, support themselves and their families financially, and invest in their childrens futures.<br/><br/>In the name of our economy, the empowerment of our citizens, and the continued progress of our society, please rescind these rules and keep birth control copay-free.

INFO - Comment: I agree with the Cornucopia Institute's suggestions that we should support stronger biodiversity in organics. These suggestions, in my own words and with my own ideas added, are as follows:<br/><br/>1) In addition to maintaining prohibition against using lands contaminated with substances incompatible with health or explicit requirements for organic classification (for instance, land contaminated with GMOs should not be used), incentives should support turning land that is not part of natural ecosystems into organic farms, rather than destroying such ecosystems to turn them into farmland. To nuance the Cornucopia's position on this slightly, I would add that this requirement should only be waived if no non-contaminated land used by people is unavailable contiguous with the borders of an already existing organic farm. Thus, if a farmer has the option to buy non-contaminated land used for a house, perhaps have the land rezoned, and use it to plant potatoes, the farmer should do that, rather than cut down a plot of forest (either on their preexisting property or other property) and cut it down. If no non-contaminated land with a preexisting human use (residence, business, farming) is available contiguous with a farm, organic farm use of ecological land should be allowed.<br/><br/>2) Conservation reserve lands removed from federal management and used as organic farms should be managed in accordance with good conservation practices. However, to nuance the Cornucopia Institute's suggestion once again, I would add that the same burden of conservation responsibilities should be placed on non-organic farmers as well, and (if it can be enforced) private residences and businesses built on these lands as well. Delicate and fragile ecosystems should be protected by all, as they are our common heritage. Placing increased responsibilities on organic farmers, compared to responsibilities for using the same land placed on other types of owners, would be an undue burden and de-incentivize use of such land for organic agriculture - an undesirable outcome, given the benefits of organic agriculture for top soil maintenance, environmental health, and human health. <br/><br/>Notes on the Cornucopia Institute proposals 3-5 <br/><br/>3) I do not understand the implications of the C.I.'s third proposal, and therefore I will pass over it rather than recommending it. <br/><br/>4) While I support the biodiversity concerns of C.I. (their fourth proposal), I am more interested in promoting the safety, quality, and affordability of organic products with regulations specific to organic food production. I would be quite open to seeing biodiversity concerns built into agricultural regulations for the U.S. as a whole, to be applied to both organic and inorganic agriculture (and, ideally, to be applied less stringently to private, business, and public properties as well), but to ask for them to be built into organic regulations alone is an undue burden on organic producers. I say this as someone who is not personally involved in or tied emotionally or financially to any person or organization involved in organic food production or sale, but as a concerned consumer who wishes to protect the availability and affordability of organic products. I believe that fairness, and a cost-benefit analysis of the unduly burdening regulations on organics that are not placed on other agricultural products, would show that the C.I.'s recommendations for a specific-to-organics biodiversity requirement is imbalanced, unjust, and excessively costly to the public health. Organic food is expensive enough already, and the public health would benefit if people consumed more of it. This is unlikely if it is made more expensive by forcing producers of said food to meet more regulations. I would be open to including a 'certified biodiverse' category to both inorganic and organic food products. But, unless it is to be required across the board, a biodiversity certification should be an optional add-on certification (thus, products could be organic and biodiverse, or one and not the other) for producers, rather than a pre-requisite for organic certification itself.<br/><br/>5) I do not understand the fifth suggestion's implications well enough to recommend or oppose it.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.

Please do away with this rule. Once in a while, my phone bill really startles me and is a lot higher than I expected. I hate when that happens -- a couple of times I've had trouble paying it. When that happens my first trip is to go get a pay day loan for some help.<br/> <br/>Cash loans have helped me many times when I couldn't make an insurance payment.  There are times that I am a little short on my bills and need some help.  Rather than get rid of my insurance altogether, I just take out a cash loan on the months that I need the extra cash.<br/> <br/>Too much regulation on my personal finances is wrong. I should be able to use a pay day advance to borrow as much as I want for however long I want, and the government shouldn't interfere.   A cap on the amount of time I can have a loan in a year is a bad idea and will have bad consequences for people that use them.<br/> <br/>Before the decision is finalized, I hope you will take into consideration all the people and families who have used cash advances for assistance in their lives.

INFO - Comment: Scientists estimate that hundreds of thousands of wolves once inhabited the lower 48 states. Decades of human persecution, however, brought them to the brink of extinction. Thanks to the Endangered Species Act, wolf populations are now making a modest recovery  but they do still remain functionally extinct in the vast majority of places where they used to live. Furthermore, wolves face an awful plight in states where theyve already lost federal protections. In Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, nearly 3,500 wolves have already been killed in just eight years.<br/><br/>The wild ancestor of the domestic dogs we know and love today, wolves are icons of Americas remaining wild landscapes. Their presence is vital to maintaining the balance of their native habitat. Wolves regulate the behavior of elk and deer populations, keeping herds from overgrazing. This allows trees to grow in greater abundance, grasses to grow taller, and animals that rely on them to flourish, strengthening the resilience of the entire ecosystem.<br/><br/>Bald eagles were afforded federal protections for long enough to allow their successful recovery. Likewise, wolves need to retain their own federal protections if they are to return to the remaining wild places that are suitable for them and that still need them. <br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments, and I urge you to cancel the plans to strip federal protections from wolves across the lower 48 states.

The proposed rule by the U.S. Department of Education would completely undermine Title IX’s requirement to establish and maintain a level playing field for women and girls in athletics.  Congress passed Title IX to ensure that educational institutions preserve and protect athletic opportunities for women and girls. By proposing to extend Title IX to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity, the administration’s proposed rule would force school districts, colleges, and universities to allow biological males who identify as female to compete in women’s sports. The administration’s proposed rewrite of Title IX undermines this important law.  Title IX has been instrumental in ensuring that girls and women across the United States have equal opportunities in athletics.  Allowing biological men who identify as female to play on women’s sports teams will cause women to lose positions on athletic teams and opportunities to compete, prizes, and scholarships, as well as risk bodily harm in certain sports. The Biden Education Department’s proposed rule would take those opportunities away for millions of women and girls and place them at risk of physical injury. Please withdraw this rule and enforce Title IX as Congress intended.

INFO - Comment: Dear Director Stone-Manning,<br/><br/>Thank you for initiating a plan to bring balance to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). I support the Public Lands Rule and encourage you to strengthen it to help ensure a vibrant future for western communities' water supplies, wildlife and way of life that make the region unique.<br/><br/>America's public lands offer some of the most readily available, fiscally responsible solutions to address drought, storm impacts, catastrophic fire and nature loss that are causing rapid changes in the West. For more than 40 years the BLM has prioritized resource extraction over other uses on public lands that are home to over 3,000 species, including migrating big game, upland game birds and waterfowl. Numerous wildlife species occur nowhere else in the country.<br/><br/>It's time to balance BLM's approach and elevate conservation to help sustain the nation's iconic open landscapes of the West that drive tourism, offer refuge for wildlife, provide public access to nature, and safeguard innumerable stories of human experiences on the land. Expanding co-stewardship with Tribal Nations will bring traditional knowledge and incorporate Indigenous expertise to decision-making to ensure these lands remain healthy and support us in the future. <br/><br/>While the draft rule is an important step forward, I believe it will need strengthening prior to its finalization. In particular, the rule should:<br/><br/>- Require the identification and protection of habitat connectivity areas. <br/>- Facilitate ecological integrity and climate resiliency across all forest-types by conserving old and mature forests from logging, wildfire and climate change, informed by the best available science and Indigenous knowledge.<br/>- Ensure that, prior to approving any development, the BLM has conducted an inventory of intact natural landscapes, including lands with wilderness characteristics, and determined that the action will not degrade any intact natural landscape.<br/>- Ensure that all eligible areas that meet the criteria are designated as Areas of Critical Environmental Concern and are properly managed.<br/>- Require the BLM to consult with Tribes to ensure it fully advances opportunities for co-stewardship, incorporation of Indigenous Knowledge, respect for Tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, protection of Tribal cultural sites, and carrying out Tribal consultation in ways that honor the unique historic and current connections of Native Americans to public lands.<br/><br/>I'm grateful for this Administration's commitment to conserving and restoring America's public lands and supporting the communities that depend on them. Now is the time to act for the critical places that are the backbone of the West. Please strengthen the Public Lands Rule and work swiftly to bring balance to BLM-managed landscapes.<br/><br/>Conserving lands and waters is essential for maintaining biodiversity, providing habitat for endangered species and fighting climate change. The future rests in your hands. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Sharon Torrisi<br/>Hermosa Beach, CA 90254

INFO - Comment: To whom it may concern:<br/><br/>The Department of the Interior needs to finalize a serious oil and natural gas leasing program for the Gulf of Mexico. A few new lease sales are not enough to meet America’s energy needs in upcoming years. Interior needs to consistently offer the resources we have in order to help us avoid more painful inflation and energy shortages.<br/><br/>The first step should be taking the option of no new lease sales in the next 5 years off the table. Nearly 15% of America’s oil comes from the Gulf, and no new lease sales in 5 years means that by 2036 we could be losing out on hundreds of thousands of barrels per day. This is not going to help contain the cost of energy in the future and will make it even harder for American energy producers to meet our country’s needs.<br/><br/>Responsible resource management means planning for the future, and a final leasing program that does not include any offshore lease sales does not do that. It can already take over 10 years to develop a new oil prospect in the Gulf—why would we want to make that process even harder? As global events have shown, America still has a need for energy independence and robust domestic supplies of natural gas and oil. It would be irresponsible to ignore those now.<br/><br/>I hope that you take this opportunity to help set America’s energy future on a strong and promising track. We need to be investing in our own natural potential, not continuing to rely on other countries for the energy we need. Moving forward with all current pending lease sales, and making a robust plan for continuing them, is how we make that world a reality.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Robert Bolduc

Almost all private health plans, even those sponsored by many religious organizations, will be required to pay for or facilitate coverage for sterilization and all FDA-approved "contraceptives," including drugs that can cause abortion.  This coverage will be provided "automatically" to employees and their dependents, including minors, whether the employees want the coverage or not. Employers will have no right to act on their values when they provide health coverage.

INFO - Comment: I urge you to reject any proposal to weaken the Forest Services National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA] process, and keep the law as it is. NEPA ensures that our communities have a say in major federal decisions that affect our public lands, health and safety. It is often the only way for people to voice their concerns about the consequences federal projects will have for their communities and demonstrate how local expertise can improve them. Our communities are safer and healthier because of NEPA.<br/><br/>While some argue that environmental analysis required by NEPA takes too long and results in bulky, unhelpful documents, such outcomes are caused by funding, staffing and training issues wholly unrelated to following the law. Instead of amending its NEPA regulations, the Forest Service should fight for more funds, personnel and education to ensure effective environmental review and public participation. <br/><br/>The Forest Service manages 193 million fragile acres of our national forests and grasslands from Puerto Rico to Alaska, from lands close to cities to remote wilderness. The Forest Service should conduct thorough analysis and weigh the irreversible consequences of each project the agency considers. These are serious decisions that deserve the hard look at environmental impacts that NEPA requires. <br/><br/>Robust public engagement and sound science are essential to informed decision making. This is, and must remain, the publics right under NEPA. When we take the time to understand each other, we can jointly develop solutions to manage our public lands. Undercutting our founding environmental law in the name of streamlining is not and never will be the answer.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Alex Azar,<br/><br/>I'm writing about President Trump's announcement of a "gag rule" on health care providers that participate in Title X, the nation's program for affordable birth control and reproductive health care that four million people rely on each year. <br/><br/>If enacted, the "gag rule" would prohibit ANY Title X health care provider from referring patients for abortion -- even if that's what the patient wants, and even if withholding that information threatens their health. It would destroy the trust between patients and doctors. And it would put the health care of the four million people who depend on Title X at risk. <br/><br/>The gag rule is also designed to make it impossible for reproductive health care providers like Planned Parenthood to serve patients in the program. This could block the 41 percent of Title X patients who rely on Planned Parenthood health centers from care, leaving them without access to life-saving services like cancer screenings, birth control, wellness exams, and more. We know that the gag rule is intended to block people from accessing care and honest information. This would be radical, and has never been implemented in the United States before.<br/>I urge you to express your opposition to this rule.  Please please do not pass this rule.  Planned Parenthood is a lifeline for so many looking for reproductive health care.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Emily Bishop<br/>  Brooklyn, NY 11206

INFO - Comment: I am writing in support of the Administration’s efforts to reform the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). For nearly four decades, NEPA’s burdensome and overbearing regulations have held back American infrastructure and killed construction jobs in towns and cities across the country <br/><br/>It’s time for that to change. We must take advantage of the opportunity we have to modernize NEPA. Reforming NEPA would unleash American investment, create good-paying, construction jobs across the country, and give a boost to our economy. <br/><br/>Right now, the United States ranks near the bottom in permitting among industrialized countries — 26 out of 33 — according to the World Bank’s most recent ‘Doing Business’ study. <br/><br/>The proposed reform from the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) would be a huge win for American workers. It will reduce delays and uncertainties and lower the overall risk for companies — resulting in more roads, bridges, and airports being built and more union jobs. <br/><br/>Modernizing NEPA would be a huge win for construction workers and we must act now.  I strongly support the Council on Environmental Quality’s proposed reforms. <br/><br/>Regards, <br/>Mark Escobar<br/>80 oak st<br/>Woonsocket, RI, 02895 <br/>

INFO - Comment: Dear Food & Drug Administration,<br/><br/>I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don't believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA's stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.<br/><br/>Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.<br/><br/>I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information. Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.<br/><br/>The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means. This goes against common sense and can put Americans' lives at risk. People deserve full access to their prescription drug information at all times, no matter their age, income, or geographic location.<br/><br/>I urge you to revise your proposed rule for patient medication information in two ways:<br/><br/>1. Require a standardized printed format that has been scientifically researched and proven to improve patient understanding.<br/><br/>2. Require the drug manufacturer to supply the printed information and have it accompany the drug product and not printed in a retail pharmacy.<br/><br/>Doing so will help save lives and improve medication outcomes.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr Gerald Caldeira<br/>CA

INFO - Comment: Dear Odin Stephens, Georgia Director Wildlife Services,<br/><br/>Mornings with no birdsong? No thanks. Birds are a natural blessing and deserve life, not extermination.<br/><br/>Thank you for providing the opportunity to comment on this important matter regarding birds of various species in Georgia. As someone who has a particular interest in the wellbeing of birds in Georgia and one of In Defense of Animals’ over 250,000 supporters, I urge you to more thoroughly assess the impacts of lethal bird management with an EIS and to move forward with Alternative 3, non-lethal management of birds.<br/><br/>The proposed alternatives that involve lethal management methods could significantly interfere with the human enjoyment of recreational activities and the natural environment. Birds are an important part of the public trust and as your report states, simply the knowledge that wild animals exist is meaningful to many people. In addition to this, birds have an inherent right to exist. <br/><br/>More in-depth research is needed before proceeding with an alternative that includes lethal management. Wildlife Services should prepare an EIS to more thoroughly investigate the negative impacts on bird populations and the environment lethal management could cause. It is also important that the agency has an accurate assessment of current bird populations. For example, the EA report states that the current wild turkey population in Georgia is unknown. <br/><br/>Additionally, ingesting poisons and avicides like Avitrol and DRC-1339 are not only a horrible way for birds to die, but they pose a risk to other wild animals, animal companions, and humans as well. Poisons can move through the food chain and affect raptors and other predators and scavengers who may eat birds exposed to these toxins. Children and animal companions can also accidentally ingest or come into contact with these poisons. The use of these lethal methods should not be a part of any alternative under consideration. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Wildlife Services should proceed with Alternative 3 and not use any non-lethal methods and additionally, an EIS should be conducted before any non-lethal methods are considered. An alternative where all non-lethal methods are exhausted first before lethal means are used should be considered as its own Alternative option separate from Alternative 1. More resources should go into reproductive inhibitors and the development of educational programs that highlight the need for humans to coexist with bird species. <br/><br/>There are a plethora of alternative non-lethal methods that are available and effective. These include human presence, exclusion methods like netting and fencing, noise and visual deterrents, habitat alteration, and relocation, among others. Wildlife Services is considering ‘Alternative 3’ which would allow only the use of non-lethal bird management methods, and it is imperative that the agency gives this option the fair consideration it warrants for the wellbeing of birds, humans, and other wild animals.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms. A Cobbett

INFO - Comment: RE: ATF 2021R-05<br/><br/>The ATF must immediately withdraw their proposed rules to criminalize so-called "ghost guns." <br/> <br/>To start, the very phrase "ghost guns" is a politically charged pejorative used to scare Americans and justify the infringement on our right to craft a homemade firearm  -  a right ancillary to the Second Amendment. <br/> <br/>In fact, some of the items being classified as "ghost guns" are best described as non-firearms because they do not meet any federal definition and are not functioning weapons. <br/> <br/>Other items referred to as "ghost guns" are completed "80% receiver" kits which can be described as "fully functioning homemade firearms" rather than the manipulative phrase "ghost guns." <br/> <br/>When the State of California and Giffords Law Center sued to force the ATF to enact gun control by "alleg[ing] threats posed by 'ghost guns,'" it was the ATF that filed a motion to DISMISS the case. <br/> <br/>Here's what the ATF said in January 2021: "While any specific crime is a tragedy, eight such crimes out of the 1.1 million violent crimes committed in the relevant six-year-period is a far cry from an overwhelming wave that would cause a State injury sufficient to confer standing. [...] Nor can California plausibly plead that those crimes would not have occurred with traditional, serialized firearms." <br/> <br/>The ATF must live by its own words and recognize the constitutional right of United States citizens to craft their own firearms to keep themselves safe. <br/> <br/>No proposed gun control law-including the proposed regulation of so-called "ghost guns"-will stop criminals from being able to obtain and use firearms in the commission of crimes.

INFO - Comment: The proposal is seriously flawed and must not be adopted, even in part. This is an obvious attempt to close the door of Planned Parenthood and other health care providers that,in addition to providing Title X services, also provide abortions. Title X patients are of lower income, and the majority are minorities.  For many patients, there is no other facility available to assume these services if these facilities close. Their patients will likely be unable to receive sny family planning services, resulting in more unwanted pregnancies and, yes, more abortions. In addition, opening Title X to organizations limited to counseling abstinence or other very unreliable birth control methods such as the rhythm method is a waste of my tax dollars and certainly not a service that Title X patients want.  They typically want, and certainly deserve, the ability and the privacy to select from the full-spectrum of FDA-approved family planning methods that are available to other women.

INFO - Comment: Stephanie Valentine<br/>Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development<br/>U.S. Department of Education<br/>Washington, DC 20002<br/>RE:  Mandatory Civil Rights Data Collection-Docket No: ED-2021-SCC-0158<br/><br/>Dear Ms. Valentine,<br/><br/>I am writing to provide comments on the Civil Rights Data Collection 2021-22. I am in full support of the addition of all items proposed by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) including the restoration of all data elements removed by the previous Administration. Specifically, I recommend the following:<br/><br/>Directed Question 1: Preschool Section 504 Only Student Enrollment. OCR proposes to start collecting preschool enrollment data for preschool students with disabilities who are served only under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504). The data would be collected by sex, race, and English learner (EL) status.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Response: I urge the collection of preschool enrollment data for preschool students with disabilities who are served under Section 504 for the 2021-22 CRDC, disaggregated by sex, race, and English Language (EL) status.<br/><br/>Directed Question 3: Nonbinary Students. OCR proposes to expand the sex category (currently male and female) to include nonbinary for the 2021-22 CRDC. OCR proposes this definition: Nonbinary refers to a student who does not identify exclusively as male or female. Nonbinary does not refer to a transgender student who identifies exclusively as either male or female. <br/><br/>Response: I support the expansion of the sex category to include nonbinary students and the related definition in the 2021-22 CRDC. <br/><br/>Directed Question 4: Should data collection include use of chemical or irritant restraints by a sworn law enforcement officer assigned to a school?<br/><br/>Recommendation: Data must be collected on the use of chemical restraint and irritant restraint by a sworn law enforcement officer and/or school staff assigned to/employed by a school, beginning with the 2021-2022 CRDC. I also support the proposed definition with the addition of irritant restraint. <br/><br/>COVID-19: Proposed New element: Percentage of students who received virtual instruction.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Add data on collection on students receiving virtual instruction and add data collection on the percentage of time students spent in virtual instruction. Disaggregated.<br/><br/>Rationale: Given the ongoing and unknown impact of COVID-19 on students, these data and their disaggregation are essential.<br/><br/>Discipline: Non-Public Schools: <br/><br/>Recommendation: Add required data collection by nonpublic schools on all CRDC elements, including all disciplinary actions impacting children with disabilities placed in nonpublic schools by school districts. This includes data measuring experiences of children with disabilities placed by school districts in non-public schools who were subjected to mechanical restraint, physical restraint, chemical restraint, irritant restraint. <br/><br/>Rationale: According to data reported under IDEA Section 618, 97 percent of students served under IDEA in non-public schools are placed there/paid for by public school districts (not parentally placed). The IDEA is the only Federal education law that provides for students to be placed by school districts in a nonpublic school as a remedy when the public school cannot provide the student with a free appropriate public education. Therefore, OCR must expand the CRDC to include these children. <br/><br/>Restraint and Seclusion: <br/><br/>Recommendation: In addition to adding chemical restraint and irritant restraint, I recommend data collection on restraint and seclusion that highlight instances where parent contact has not been confirmed (attempted but not confirmed or no meeting held). Disaggregated.<br/><br/>Early Childhood Education:<br/><br/>Recommendation: Make all restored data elements mandatory not optional for 2021-22 CRDC which includes key data on whether schools provide preschool services to IDEA-eligible children.<br/><br/>Section 504-Only Students:<br/><br/>Recommendation: Require data collection on Section 504-only status throughout the CRDC. <br/><br/>Rationale: The CRDC is the only federal-level data collection that yields information on Section 504-only students. Therefore, disaggregating data elements to include 504-only students provides critical information.<br/><br/>Teachers and other Personnel (funded with federal, state, and/or local funds):<br/><br/>Recommendation: Make all restored data elements in this category mandatory for 2021-22 CRDC. Also, Add “Number of Teachers Certified in Specified Areas (mathematics; science; English as a Second Language; or special education)” to the List of 2021-22 CRDC Data Elements in the Appendix. <br/><br/>Rationale: OCR has referenced and specified the “Number of teachers Certified in Specified Areas (mathematics; science; English as a Second Language; or special education)” in Supporting Statement A, however, this element is not shown in the List of 2021-22 CRDC Data Elements in the Appendix and must be formally added. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

INFO - Comment: Everyone deserves health care, and all patients should be treated with respect they are due because of their God-given dignity. But when a health care worker will gladly provide routine care to a patient who identifies as transgender, but objects to performing gender transition procedures, that is not sex discrimination. It is an objection to the procedure, not the person.<br/><br/>It is alarming that HHS appears to be considering imposing an abortion mandate under Section 1557. Interpreting a non-discrimination law to require the taking of innocent life in the womb would be both appalling and unlawful.<br/><br/>HHS should follow the law and exclude any requirements to provide, perform, or cover, or refer for abortions.  And I urge HHS to withdraw its proposed requirements on gender transition procedures. Health care workers, religious hospitals, and other faith-based medical facilities should be free to exercise their best clinical judgement and act in accordance with their conscience.

These proposals would drastically undermine the Act and set us in exactly the wrong direction just as the planet is experiencing a sixth mass extinction period.<br/><br/>For nearly 45 years the Endangered Species Act has served as a vital last line of defense for plants and animals on the verge of extinction. This popular law has been remarkably effective, preventing the extinction of 99 percent of the species under its care. <br/><br/>The proposed Endangered Species Act regulatory changes would undermine the Act by: <br/><br/>-Eliminating automatic protections for species listed as threatened under the Act <br/>-Allowing federal agencies to ignore the known threats to vulnerable species from climate change <br/>-Permitting habitat that is critical to the conservation of a listed species to be destroyed bit by bit<br/>-Letting federal agencies off the hook for protecting species listed under the Act as long as their actions wont speed up a species decline to extinctionthe exact opposite of the standard set in the Act itself, which seeks to ensure that federal agency actions dont undermine a species ability to survive and recover<br/><br/>I strongly urge the Trump administration to withdraw these damaging proposals.

INFO - Comment: Dear Fish and Wildlife Service,<br/><br/>Thank you for undoing some of the Trump administration’s damage to critical Endangered Species Act regulations. I am heartened by many aspects of your proposed restoration. <br/><br/>However, there are multiple aspects of your proposed rules that are insufficient for the challenges that endangered wildlife are facing.  <br/><br/>First, you must go back to the drawing board and fully restore section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, which governs interagency consultation. For 50 years it's been established that the federal government should not engage in activities that could jeopardize species' survival or destroy habitat they need to survive and recover.  <br/><br/>Specifically, the Biden administration must rescind the addition of “as a whole” to section 402.02. This Trump-era language created an enormous loophole, inconsistent with the intent of the Endangered Species Act itself. The nefarious “as a whole” language is a free pass to destroy critical habitat as long as the total destruction of a species’ entire critical habitat is avoided. This is especially damaging for wide-ranging and migratory species, from piping plover to marbled murrelet, from salmon to lynx. This language also ignores the cumulative impact of different causes of habitat destruction over time. And it goes against the science-based establishment of critical habitat to ensure both the species survival and recovery, instead treating some areas of critical habitat as expendable.   <br/><br/>Additional definition changes from the Trump era that need to be reversed include one that creates unnecessary confusion when examining an agency action that is ongoing, or a continuation of past activities as opposed to something new (“environmental baseline” section 402.02).   <br/><br/>Additionally, you must reverse Trump’s damaging changes in section 424.11(e) that allow plants and animals to be prematurely delisted. It is essential that species recovery meets all science-based standards before removing the backstop of Endangered Species Act protections that have kept so many species alive.  <br/><br/>Each of the many changes to Endangered Species Act regulations made by the Trump administration weakened protections for threatened and endangered species at a time when we must be doing everything in our power to fight the biodiversity crisis and recover species from the brink of extinction. Despite the broad support for restoring and strengthening the rules that implement the Act, you’ve left multiple loopholes from the Trump-era rollbacks in place, which will undoubtedly jeopardize future efforts to protect wildlife and habitat. By failing to fully restore the Endangered Species Act rules, you've left a significant job less than half done. Now is the time to get this right; we have no more time to waste.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Judith Brey<br/>2101 Winfield Dr  Reedsburg, WI 53959-2237

There are many critical issues which could have a negative impact on residents in the Ocean City area.  Unfortunately many of these concerns do not appear to have been fully explored and could  result in significant danger for the community at large.  Listed, are a few of the topics which have not been given adequate research and resultant communication to the homeowners by the Orstead Organization.  They include but are not limited to the following:  the potential danger of cables being installed through 35th street from the beach and then running through or near the 34th street playground.  The threat of radiation from these cables into the surrounding area.  The negative impact of home values as a result of the Ocean Wind Project.  Endangerment of the coastline including wildlife and ocean life.  How will the beaches be affected with the ocean floor being disrupted.  This area around 35th Street is one of the sections of Ocean City which currently has not flooded.  Communication to homeowners and residents should be vastly improved about the status of this project.  As long time homeowner (23 years) we should have been included in the regular updates.  Notes would be helpful from recent Wind farm meetings on the Ocean Wind Project.  The ocean is the last somewhat clean place on the planet. We need to protect our Ocean and the coastline at all cost.  This seems to be a project Gov. Murphy wants as a feather in his cap.  Once windmills are in the ocean there will be no going back.  We will never  be able to put a finger in the gap to keep the flood of a future of bigger and more windmills in our ocean.  Can anyone promise the ocean will not become more polluted, and will someone be able to assure the windmills will not leave a negative imprint on the earth?

The Roadless Rule was implemented with unprecedented public support to protect some of our nation’s most pristine public lands, including large parts of the Tongass National Forest. It retains wide bipartisan support, including from 96 percent of people who commented on the recent rollback of the rule in Alaska. <br/><br/>In the middle of multiple national crises, the Trump administration focused on finalizing its plan to remove crucial protections for Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, serving industry interests aiming to open the forests to clear-cutting. Anything other than a full reinstatement of the Roadless Rule will have far-reaching impacts on indigenous communities, climate, and wildlife, and ignores overwhelming public support for the safeguard, including from Alaska Natives, Alaskans, and taxpayers across the nation.  <br/><br/>President-elect Biden promised bold climate action — and full protection of the Tongass is an integral part of that. It’s already stored over 3 billion tons of carbon — about 15% of what the United States produces in a year — and continues to store more and more each passing year.  <br/><br/>I urge you to fully reinstate the Roadless Rule protection to the Tongass National Forest and put the public interest, environmental justice, our public lands, and taxpayers above corporate profits.    <br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Denise Lytle<br/>Woodbridge, NJ 07095

That is why long-standing rules have historically prohibited SBA funds from going to houses of worship in the first place. Do not allow these safeguards to fall away permanently. <br/> <br/>Additionally, since taxpayer funds were funneled to churches through Covid-19 relief programs less than a year ago, there has already been widespread abuse reported.

INFO - Comment: As a supporter of Defenders of Wildlife and someone who cares about protecting wolves in the Greater Yellowstone region and throughout the Northern Rockies, I strongly urge your agency to scrap your proposal to remove Endangered Species Act protections for these amazing animals.  Rather than repackaging a severely flawed plan that has already been rejected by a federal judge, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service needs to take a fresh look at the management of wolves in the region.  The proposal allows as many as 1,000 wolves to be killed as soon as they lose the protections of the Endangered Species Act  -- slashing the population by as much as two thirds. Such drastic reductions in wolf numbers would be a serious obstacle preventing wolves from establishing a sustainable and connected wolf population in the region.  Furthermore, the current proposal is the product of a flawed process and will likely result in the same types of policy conflicts and legal battles that have plagued wolf management in the past.  I strongly urge you to work with wildlife biologists to revise your plan and collaborate with wildlife conservationists, ranchers, tourism officials, hunters and other interested individuals to develop new science-based state wolf management plans that are more informed, inclusive and balanced.  Thank you for considering my comments.

INFO - Comment: These closing weeks prior to CMS's deadline to evaluate the Sunshine Act provisions has left me "sleepless in Ft. Lauderdale" related to the alarming proposed CMS policy that could essentially eliminate reporting exemption for accredited continuing medical education (CME) under the Sunshine Act.<br/><br/>As the founder and owner of a woman-owned small business   A CME accredited provider for the past 20 years   I have had the privilege of designing, developing, accrediting and providing certified CME programs for the federal government, academic institutions, health systems, and commercial supporters alike. Our approach to CME has always been governed under the strict criteria of the ACCME and other accreditation bodies (ACPE for pharmacists, ANCC for nurses, ADA for dentists, APA for psychologists, and so on), when interprofessional education is established. As a result, the funder of CME is the insignificant factor in a consistent process to ensure accurate, fair-balanced education for health care professionals. <br/><br/>CME is a vital component of the continued training and education required of our physicians, and accredited CME is the way my organization has provided reliable healthcare education for 20 years. Accredited CME provides numerous safeguards against any potential for bias, whether in curriculum development or presentation, and allows organizations like mine to provide consistent standards of practice in place regardless of who is funding the education.<br/><br/>I ask you to carefully and responsibility consider the need to promote physician participation in CME, rather than adopt policies that could diminish it.  <br/><br/>In CMS' February 2013 Final Rule on Sunshine Act implementation, your agency wisely created a bright line "CME exemption" that made it clear to physician participants that they could present at, and attend, accredited continuing education programs without risking the stigma and reputational impact that accompanies a listing in the Open Payments system. <br/><br/>It is my understanding that your stated goal is actually to expand the definition of "Sunshine exempt" CME to take into account programs that may be accredited for nurses, optometrists, pharmacists, and others. If this is so, I wholeheartedly endorse this goal, but am concerned that your recent proposal of July 3rd would instead eliminate the current CME "safe harbor" from reporting by redefining CME payments as "indirect payments" which may be reportable.<br/><br/>Please ensure that indirect commercial support for CME programs, where the accredited provider exercise complete discretion on the content, remains exempted from reporting under the Open Payments system. It is vital to America's patients that their healthcare providers remain well educated and informed on the latest medical science in their field, and therefore, we must encourage, rather than discourage, participation in CME. Likewise, physicians need clear rules that provide a safe harbor from Open Payments reporting when they participate in accredited CME.  This is what I understand was intended by Congress and exists in the Final Rule as it currently stands, and I would encourage you to create a similarly clear "safe harbor" for doctors and CME at the conclusion of this process.

I would like to suggest though that you consider the following points in your final rule.<br/><br/>Timeline:<br/><br/>When congress initially drafted legislation to make a Collision Avoidance System mandatory for all aircraft with 10 or more passenger seats, or weighing more than 33,000 pounds, a compliance date of Jan 1, 2000 was chosen. Unfortunately due to political reasons the bill was delayed and when it finally became law, the compliance date was changed to Jan 1, 2003. This date happens to also coincide with the date for mandatory equipage in several ICAO states. We feel that this is a realistic compliance date, as the hardware is readily available, most aircraft have already approved TSO for the installation and many more are already prewired for TCAS II. Even when that was not the case, a major cargo carrier was able to design, receive approval and install TCAS II in several aircraft that were to be used as passenger carriers in less than 9 months after the decision was made to convert those aircraft. Thus it is our opinion, that an effective date of Jan 1, 2003, as envisioned by congress, is realistic. The FAA might consider an extension to the date of October 1, 2003 if an operator could prove extenuating circumstances. There is no reason not to realize the benefits of this regulation as soon as possible, considering that in some cases the operators could comply by simply sliding the TCAS equipment into a rack on aircraft already prewired for TCAS II.<br/><br/>Alternative Technology (ADS-B):<br/><br/>I fully support the FAA's intent to look forward and embrace new technologies when they become available. We are not opposed to the development and future application of ADS-B, it has some very exciting potential applications, such as runway incursion avoidance, close parallel approaches and more. However, it can and must not be used as the "last bubble of safety" in Collision Avoidance. We must not have the all three elements of CNS (Communication, Navigation, Surveillance) with a single point of failure such as the loss of the GPS signal, or of the onboard GPS receiver. After the horrible events of September 11, we also must guard against the real threat of a willful and malicious jamming of the extremely weak GPS signal by hostile individuals or entities. Such jamming equipment is available readily on the black market and will render GPS and thus ADS-B inoperable for up to a hundred miles from the jammer's location . Furthermore ADS-B based Collision Avoidance would utilize ground based radar processed data in order to "see" Mode C transponders (TIS-B). This would only be available in less than 50% of the US surface area served by these radars and not be available outside of the US at all. Just when Collision Avoidance becomes even more critical, when radar is inoperative, a big part of potential threats will not be avoided. For these reasons alone, a Collision Avoidance System based on ADS-B is not possible. We therefore support only a Collision Avoidance System that is based on TCAS II, but are not opposed to an enhanced unit that uses ADS-B to improve range and resolution. The last line of defense must remain with the proven, independent of ground or space based resources, TCAS II. Thus any possible pleas to extend the compliance date to "develop alternative technology" should be rejected.<br/><br/>Sincerely submitted by:<br/><br/>Bill Cason<br/>UPS B757 First Officer<br/>member - Independent Pilots' Association<br/><br/>

INFO - Comment:  <br/><br/>September 2, 2021<br/><br/>Administrator Regan<br/>Environmental Protection Agency<br/>1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.<br/>Washington, DC 20460<br/><br/>Acting Assistant Secretary Pinkham<br/>Department of the Army<br/>Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works)<br/>108 Army Pentagon<br/>Washington, DC 20310<br/><br/>RE: Docket ID Number: EPA-HQ-OW-2021-0328: Pre-proposal Public Meetings and Recommendations Regarding the Definition of “Waters of the United States” <br/><br/>Dear Administrator Regan and Acting Assistant Secretary Pinkham,<br/><br/>The John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, Inc. is pleased to offer comments relative to the above docket number.  The National Heritage Corridor was established by Congress to preserve and protect the cultural treasures and natural landscapes of the Blackstone River Valley – Birthplace of America’s Industrial Revolution.  Among our priorities is to improve the quality of the Blackstone River (Massachusetts and Rhode Island) with the goal of developing a fishable/swimmable river.<br/><br/>Consequently, we request that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers repeal the Navigable Waters Rule (Rule) as swiftly as possible to keep our nation’s most vulnerable waterways out of harm. <br/><br/>As it stands, the Rule jeopardizes the health and safety of our streams, rivers, wetlands, and consequently our communities. Repealing the Rule quickly before the end of the year will reduce the risk of pollution to those waterbodies while the EPA creates a new, more protective Rule. Our groundwater resources, wetlands, and ephemeral streams provide essential ecosystem services and must be protected in the interim. <br/><br/>Waterways of New England, water does not respect political boundaries; it is interconnected. The Merrimack River flows for over sixty miles in New Hampshire before crossing into Massachusetts, and the Taunton, Blackstone, and Ten Mile Rivers all originate in Massachusetts but end in Rhode Island’s Narragansett Bay. Similarly, the state’s largest river, the Connecticut, enters Massachusetts from Vermont and New Hampshire, and continues into Connecticut. The interstate nature of our waterways necessitates strong federal protections that ensure no state suffers poor water quality due to another’s policy shortcomings. Disparate state approaches make states downstream of more lax states vulnerable to reduced drinking water protection and weakened flood control. <br/><br/>Massachusetts is also home to four Wild & Scenic River systems. It is crucial that the small streams and tributaries in the headwater regions of these watersheds remain protected to ensure that these nationally significant rivers continue to thrive, especially amidst a changing climate and growing development pressures. <br/><br/>Rivers and streams are a key part of our state’s recreation economy. In 2019, outdoor recreation supported 113,794 jobs and $5.5 billion in wages and salaries.  Fish and wildlife populations only thrive with the clean, cool flows provided by healthy wetlands and headwater streams. The Rule protects these resources that provide recreational opportunities for residents, and the employment opportunities for those who steward our waterways and open spaces. This is especially important as the pandemic continues in the United States, as people recreate closer to home in smaller streams and parks. <br/><br/>Although far less arid than the West, Massachusetts still experiences severe drought, and our rivers, drinking water supply, agricultural industry, and ecosystems have suffered as a result. We need to ensure our drinking water supplies are protected, as climate change brings more frequent and more severe droughts to our region. Allowing the existing Rule to prevail imperils access to secure, safe, clean water for families and businesses <br/><br/>We ask that the EPA repeal the Rule as quickly as possible, and we ask the Army Corps to support this policy to ensure robust protection of the country’s water resources. <br/><br/>Thank you for considering our comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>RICHARD T. MOORE, Board Chair<br/>Blackstone Heritage Corridor, Inc.<br/><br/>670 Linwood Avenue<br/>Whitinsville, Massachusetts 01588<br/>

INFO - Comment: Dear Attorney General William Barr,<br/><br/>I urge you to reject the Departments proposal to change the rules that apply to taxpayer-funded faith-based organizations that deliver social services. The proposed changes would harm religious freedom.<br/><br/>The proposed rules strip away religious freedom protections from people, often vulnerable and marginalized, who use government-funded social services. Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.<br/> <br/>At the same time, the rules expand religious exemptions to taxpayer-funded faith-based providers. This paves the way for providers to refuse to provide key services and opens the door to discrimination in taxpayer-funded programs. The proposed regulations put the interests of taxpayer-funded entities, some of which receive millions of dollars each year of government money, ahead of the needs of people seeking critical services.<br/> <br/>I urge you to reject these proposed changes and protect, rather than undermine, the rights of individuals your social service programs are designed to serve.<br/><br/>I have every intention of voting against any and all candidates who wish to blur the lines between Church and State.

Guns sold without background checks—both online and at gun shows—are a huge source for gun traffickers and people looking to avoid a background check. These guns often end up trafficked across state lines, recovered at crime scenes in major cities, and used against police officers. This contributes to the gun violence epidemic plaguing our country. The long-standing lack of clarity around which sellers must become licensed and run background checks has made this problem all the worse. <br/><br/>I support the clear common-sense standard laid out in this rule: Anyone offering guns for sale online or at a gun show is presumed to be trying to make a profit and should therefore be licensed and run a background check on their customers.

INFO - Comment: Being an avid air traveler, often with my wife and two little boys, I applaud the FAA as it does a fantastic job of keeping the NAS and the people/property under it safe.  It does a much better job of protecting its pilots and other highly trained personnel from risky work environments (e.g. fatigue) unlike my personal profession of medicine which seeks to abuse its few most highly trained personnel<br/><br/>I suggest there are two general components of the legislation by congress and FAA interpretation that, due to rapidly advancing technologies and interest, need to be better considered<br/><br/>First, the time has come to design legislation allowing the non-hobby use of small UASs.  I have briefly reviewed the document "Integration of Civil Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in the NAS Roadmap - First Ed 2013." And I am encouraged the FAA realizes the value and potential for the field.  Two examples are local search and rescue rapid responders, or, farmers/ranchers in remote locations with large land plot.  I expect there would be licensing process to show due diligence of the operator and her/his understanding of civil UAS flight safety regulations.  <br/><br/>Second, this "Interpretation..." needs to make allowances for the safe pursuit of "first-person-view," or, FPV, flight activities as already guided by the AMA. The FAA takes too strong of a top-down hand on a sport and industry that is overwhelmingly pursued by a quickly growing number of honest, careful enthusiast.  FPV is one of the most awe inspiring, innovation inspiring and enjoyable aspects of the model aviation hobby that I have discovered.  I support it being done safely, as guided by the Academy of Model Aeronautics (AMA), but there is no good reason to ban from the thousands of law abiding, good people that do enjoy it responsibly.  I am aware that it is used recklessly, primarily by those who fly over people.  But, much like firearms or off-road vehicles, it should be easy to create, and expect use of, ubiquitous and safe venues for the enjoyment of this sport.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments.<br/>Best regards,<br/>Ben Luman

INFO - Comment: Scientists estimate that hundreds of thousands of wolves once inhabited the lower 48 states. Decades of human persecution, however, brought them to the brink of extinction. Thanks to the Endangered Species Act, wolf populations are now making a modest recovery  but they do still remain functionally extinct in the vast majority of places where they used to live. Furthermore, wolves face an awful plight in states where theyve already lost federal protections. In Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, nearly 3,500 wolves have already been killed in just eight years.<br/><br/>The wild ancestor of the domestic dogs we know and love today, wolves are icons of Americas remaining wild landscapes. Their presence is vital to maintaining the balance of their native habitat. Wolves regulate the behavior of elk and deer populations, keeping herds from overgrazing. This allows trees to grow in greater abundance, grasses to grow taller, and animals that rely on them to flourish, strengthening the resilience of the entire ecosystem.<br/><br/>Bald eagles were afforded federal protections for long enough to allow their successful recovery. Likewise, wolves need to retain their own federal protections if they are to return to the remaining wild places that are suitable for them and that still need them. <br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments, and I urge you to cancel the plans to strip federal protections from wolves across the lower 48 states.

Reforming NEPA would unleash American investment, create jobs across the country, and give a boost to our economy. <br/><br/>Right now, the United States ranks near the bottom in permitting among industrialized countries - 26 out of 33 - according to the World Bank's most recent 'Doing Business' study.<br/><br/>The Council on Environmental Quality's proposed reform would be a huge win for American workers and businesses across the country. It will reduce delays and uncertainties and lower the overall risk for companies - resulting in greater transparency and predictability for local governments and small businesses.<br/><br/>The list of stakeholders who would benefit is long. They include but are not limited to: state and local governments, infrastructure workers and the building trades, agriculture, clean energy, forestry, manufacturing, transportation, and small businesses.<br/><br/>The benefits of reforming NEPA are incalculable and we must act now.

INFO - Comment: Tina Namian, Branch Chief<br/>Policy and Program Development Division<br/>FNS, USDA<br/>RE: Docket ID FNS-2011-0029<br/>Dear Ms. Namian:<br/>We commend USDA for updating the meal pattern and nutrition standards for the Child and<br/>Adult Care Food Program, as well as for school meal programs serving school-based Pre-K and<br/>afterschool programs. This is an important opportunity to strengthen the child nutrition programs<br/>role in addressing the nutritional shortfalls in our nations childrens diets and helping to address<br/>hunger and obesity.<br/>We agree with USDA that the goal of improving good nutrition for low-income children in child<br/>care and afterschool programs is best served by a balanced approach that improves nutrition while<br/>allowing providers to continue to afford participation in CACFP. An updated food program,<br/>offering meals consistent with the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, will provide much-needed good<br/>nutrition to children in child care, Pre-K and afterschool programs. To ensure children get the full<br/>value from the proposed improvements we offer the following comments.<br/>Improvements we endorse:<br/> Option to claim a meat or meat alternate as a meal component for breakfast.<br/> Tofu allowed as a meat alternate.<br/> Offer vs Serve option for afterschool programs.<br/> Sugar limits for yogurt and flavored milk.<br/>In response to USDAs request for comments on the beverages proposals, we offer the following<br/>recommendations to ensure healthier beverages for young children in child care:<br/> Disallow flavored milk for children under age five.<br/> Limit juice on the menu to no more than once a day.<br/> Make water available as developmentally appropriate.<br/>Recommendations for improvements:<br/> Allow the introduction of baby foods consistent with parents plans not on a fixed timeline.<br/> Do not separate the fruit and vegetables components: maintain the current flexibility.<br/> Adopt only the WIC sugar limit for cereal.<br/> Do not add a fourth age group (13-18 years of age) to the childrens meal pattern without<br/>additional funding.<br/> For schools, maintain the ability to offer a single menu using school meal rules for Pre-K<br/>and afterschool programs for school-based and school-vended programs.<br/>We endorse the following proposed improvements and offer recommendations for strong clear<br/>standards and practical implementation:<br/> Proposed requirement to serve one whole grain a day:<br/> We recommend compliance with this requirement be assessed during on-site<br/>monitoring reviews not through meal deductions and monthly menu auditing.<br/> This requirement should be applicable only when a grain is served during the day. For<br/>example, an afterschool provider serving only a snack might not have a grain<br/>component each day.<br/> Proposed on-site frying ban:<br/> We recommend USDA issue guidance with a clear definition: deep fat frying<br/>(submerging food in hot oil) is disallowed and stir frying and sauting are allowed.<br/> We recommend training and technical assistance on the best practice of limiting the<br/>service of commercially prepared fried foods to no more than once per week.<br/>In response to the request for suggestions for implementing the best practices:<br/> We recommend USDA create CACFP model wellness policies and a USDA recognition<br/>program (similar to HealthierUS Schools Challenge) featuring the CACFP best practices<br/>and child care-wide policies, such as eliminating sugary beverages.<br/> We endorse the proposed best practices structure and protections from additional costs<br/>and disciplinary action.<br/>Implementation of the new rules will require ample lead time, phased-in changes, and grace<br/>periods. Implementation and administration of this new rule will be resource-intensive. In<br/>advance of implementation, USDA should supply training materials for providers, staff and cooks<br/>in English, Spanish and other languages as identified by State agencies.<br/>Maintaining the practical balance needed to improve the nutritional value of the meals served<br/>without diminishing the value of CACFP to providers and the children they serve is absolutely<br/>essential. We know that providers stop participating in CACFP because of onerous administrative<br/>burdens and inadequate reimbursement rates. We urge USDA to avoid creating new<br/>recordkeeping burdens or increasing the risk of unreimbursed costs due to disallowed meals and<br/>snacks. Compliance with the new requirements can be assessed during on-site monitoring reviews,<br/>rather than through monthly audits and deductions. USDAs already successful implementation of<br/>the requirement to serve non-fat or low-fat milk provides an excellent model.<br/>In summary, we endorse the need to update the CACFP and relevant school meals rules, and urge<br/>USDA to make the necessary changes to the proposed rule. <br/>

It would make it easier for a much broader range of schools can claim a right to discriminate while getting federal moneyeven though Title IX wouldnt allow that.<br/><br/>This can have life-changing impacts for students who are disciplined, mistreated, or forced out of school as a result. They can face enormous costs, like having to interrupt or even end their degree, losing their tuition money, and missing out on important professional opportunities.<br/>Giving many more schools a blank check to discriminate at the expense of women and girls, LGBTQ students, pregnant or parenting students, and others who are protected by Title IX is exactly the opposite of what the Department of Education is supposed to be doing.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Education to do its job, enforce the law, and protect students instead of finding more ways to shield schools from liability.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr. Peter Kahigian<br/>Haverhill, MA 01831<br/>peter_kahigian@hotmail.com

INFO - Comment: The Pacific walrus meets the criteria for listing under the Endangered<br/>Species Act and must be listed immediately if it's to have a chance at<br/>survival and recovery.<br/><br/>An unprecedented number of walruses have hauled out on the North Slope<br/>of Alaska this summer because their sea ice habitat has retreated<br/>hundreds of miles away. Walruses that are forced to haul out on land<br/>have a harder time finding food and are more vulnerable to disturbances<br/>that could lead to stampeding and trampling mortalities.<br/><br/>The recently-released U.S. Geological Survey study shows a 40% chance<br/>that walrus will be on a pathway to extinction by the end of this<br/>century. As scary as those odds are, they are likely far too optimistic<br/>because the study relied on  modeling that underestimates greenhouse<br/>gas emissions, global warming and rates of Arctic sea-ice loss.<br/><br/>The report also dismissed as negligible the impacts from reduced food<br/>supply for the walrus. Sea-ice loss in the Bering Sea is already<br/>leading to declines in the walrus's bottom-dwelling prey; ocean<br/>acidification is making Arctic waters increasingly corrosive and<br/>potentially lethal to the clams and mussels it eats. Still, the USGS<br/>determined that these threats have negligible influences on the<br/>walrus's future. The study would have found a significantly worse<br/>outlook for  walruses if it had used more realistic assessments of<br/>these threats.<br/><br/>The Pacific walrus needs the full protections of the Endangered Species<br/>Act to survive into the coming century. Please list the Pacific walrus<br/>under the Endangered Species Act, designate critical habitat, and<br/>design and implement a recovery plan as soon as possible.

INFO - Comment: ATF authorized the first pistol brace products almost ten years ago.  These products provide an attachment to pistols that distributes weight of the pistol to the forearm and were designed to help disabled persons control and safely shoot brace-equipped pistols.<br/><br/>Guidance regarding the legality of braces and their features has been issued by ATF over the last 10 years. This guidance seemed to attempt to balance the needs of disabled persons with ATF’s desire to prevent the brace from being used as a stock, which in ATF’s view makes the braced device a rifle subject to the National Firearms Act, including its rules on transfer, the imposition of a $200 transfer tax, and restrictions on transport and possession.<br/><br/>These proposed rules utterly disrupt this balance and fly in the face of the purpose for which the brace was designed and sold.  The proposed rules are highly restrictive and would cause the vast majority of the millions of braced pistols in the hands of US citizens to be reclassified as NFA items.  This reclassification would impose incredible costs on US citizens who have purchased braces and braced products in the last ten years and significantly limit the future availability of these devices to the disabled community.<br/><br/>Worse is that the rule’s point criteria used to evaluate braced pistols to determine if they are pistols or NFA items penalize firearms with features that are useful to the disabled and have nothing to do with whether the brace acts as a stock.  Examples include restrictions on the minimum and maximum weights of braced firearms, and brace adjustability and attachment methods. Moreover, ATF ignores the benefits of features that are clearly beneficial to the disabled community, and instead based on unsupported conjecture proposes rules that these features (such as adjustability) define the brace as a stock, denying beneficial features and making the device less effective or unavailable to the disabled community.<br/><br/>ATF is prohibited from making such discriminatory rules under The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Section 504 states that “no… individual with a disability… shall be excluded from, denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any activity that… is conducted by any Executive agency.”  Here ATF’s rulemaking discriminates against disabled persons by arbitrarily limiting design characteristics that enhance the effectiveness of the brace design for the disabled person and for no discernible purpose. <br/><br/>The balance that previously existed in ATF’s pistol brace guidance and rulemaking has been lost.  We urge ATF to reconsider the proposed rule in order to make appropriate accommodations for the disabled, as originally intended and required by statute.

INFO - Comment: As a small-business operator in New York, I'm very disappointed to learn that the FDA is considering a ban on licensed retailers selling menthol cigarettes to adults 21 and older. Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning menthol cigarettes could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since menthol cigarettes alone make up 36% of all cigarette sales in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of menthol could undermine my ability to operate by significantly impacting my revenue. Plain and simple: it's misguided and could force small businesses to close.<br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, menthol cigarettes could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime under the laws of all 50 states.  Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of menthol cigarettes is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.<br/>

I support efforts to improve quality initiatives and quality  programming and infection control programming. However, I do not think it follows that placing specific requirements in terms of number of staff and assignment of their responsibilities improves practices in these areas. The new rules, as I understand them, require that certain specific tasks regarding compliance and infection control be assigned to one staff member and that one staff member be " dedicated" to these functions .  This seems illogical and may in fact defeat the goal of having effective programs in these areas. A small nursing facility may not be able to afford these requirements, while one dedicated staff member  may be too too few resources for a large facility to be effective. <br/><br/>Additionally the requirement that a physician or a physician assistant or NP be required to do an in person assessment of a resident before sending out for an unscheduled transfer. Skilled nursing facilities do not have the availability of a physician or NP on site 24/7, regardless of whether they are in an urban or rural environment. However, the lack of these medical staff in some sections of the country would add additional difficulties in meeting this rule. As a result there would be delays in treatment that could potentially be catastrophic and would likely expose the facility and physician to litigation. Most facilities have processes in place to contact an on call provider prior to transporting for medical treatment outside the facility, so there is already a process in place for determining emergent transports. Requiring that an on site assessment be performed would be burdensome for all involved.<br/><br/>Please reconsider these rules and determine other means, in consultation with industry experts, for achieving the desired outcomes. <br/><br/>Thank you

INFO - Comment: This comment is in regard to the Proposed Rule titled the “Regulations to Implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA),” (“Proposed Rule,” RIN number 3046–AB30). I am deeply concerned with how the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission seeks to implement the PWFA.<br/><br/>In 2022, Congress passed and the President signed into law the “Pregnant Workers Fairness Act” (PWFA). While this bill was intended to accommodate pregnant women in their places of work, the EEOC is sidestepping congressional intent so it can implement an abortion leave mandate for businesses.<br/><br/>Nowhere in the PWFA does it refer to abortion.<br/><br/>Even the Senate Democrat lead sponsor of this legislation, Senator Bob Casey (D-PA), stated from the Senate floor that the EEOC “could not . . . issue any regulation that requires abortion leave.”<br/><br/>Additionally, the Proposed Rule does not relate “pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions” to womanhood. EEOC, in fact, says explicitly that the only reason it uses “women” (sparingly) is because it is quoting other sources, not because it has chosen to use that word. The Proposed Rule states: “In the NPRM, when using language from specific sources, EEOC uses the language of that source ( e.g., “women” or “pregnant women”).”<br/><br/>One example of the ambiguity here is that “related medical conditions” explicitly includes lactation in the Proposed Rule. Because the EEOC has chosen not to relate these conditions to women, it is completely plausible that workplaces would be forced to accommodate men seeking to “chestfeed” or seeking fertility treatment. This is unacceptable and limits resources for women in the workplace.<br/><br/>Only women can get pregnant and give birth. Only women can breastfeed. Businesses should not be forced to provide abortion leave. Women are harmed and at a disadvantage when resources meant uniquely for women are provided to men. <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of this comment.

This Proposed Rule undercuts states that are protecting female athletes from ongoing discrimination and leaves women without protection when male students are allowed to join their teams. In fact, the majority of states have introduced legislation to protect female athletes, and so far twenty of them have passed those protections into law. This is not a minority viewpoint: it's common sense.<br/><br/>Women deserve a fair shot in sports, but when males are allowed to compete in female sports contests, that fair shot disappears. Males have an undeniable biological advantage over female athletes no matter the amount of testosterone suppression is taken–but the administration will allow males to compete with females anyway if this rule is finalized. When this happens, girls and women lose out on championships, scholarships, and other opportunities meant just for them.<br/> <br/>The Proposed Rule states that if schools apply “a one-size-fits-all approach, they rely on overbroad generalizations that do not account for the nature of particular sports, the level of competition at issue, and the grade or education level of students to which they apply.” Those schools using that a standard across the board would thus not be in compliance with the rule as proposed. This leaves the door open to dramatically confuse schools and states on what qualifies as legitimate reasons, such as physical harm, to keep women’s sports for biological women only.<br/> <br/>I am calling on the Biden Administration to not put ideology and politics over girls and women. Please rescind this rule and make it clear for schools that women’s sports is for biological women only, as Title IX originally intended.<br/> <br/>Thank you for considering this request.

INFO - Comment: As a clinician, I urge CMS to ensure the final Physician Fee Schedule for 2023 strengthens access to psychological services and meets the mental health needs of underserved communities. This year's proposal has serious implications for equity in access to behavioral health care. I also urge CMS to work with the American Psychological Association (APA) Services to develop new rate-setting methodologies to better reflect the cost of furnishing services and ensure Medicare beneficiaries have access to needed mental and behavioral health services.<br/><br/>Strengthen the Practice of Psychology<br/>BHI Codes <br/>I support CMS' proposed coding and payment for General Behavioral Health Integration (BHI) to recognize psychologists' role in integrated care. I appreciate CMS' support for multiple evidence-based models of integrated care, as it allows psychologists the flexibility required to support the behavioral health needs of the broader community.<br/><br/>Medicare Potentially Underutilized Services<br/>I appreciate CMS' request for comments on potentially underutilized services, as several of the services CMS identified are performed by psychologists. I recommend CMS create additional Cognitive Assessment & Care codes without the medication reconciliation service because medication management is outside the scope of a psychologist's license in many states. Additionally, I recommend CMS allow reimbursement for Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Obesity services provided by psychologists. <br/><br/>Chronic Pain Management and Treatment (CPM) Bundles<br/>I ask CMS to create additional bundled pain management codes that do not include medication management. I am concerned that psychologists would be excluded from this new bundled service because in most states medication management is outside the scope of a psychologist's license. Psychologists play a critical role in implementing non-pharmacological approaches to treatment, which may be safer or more effective for some patients, as well as team-based comprehensive pain management.<br/><br/>Telehealth<br/>Many patients in rural and underserved areas are now able to access mental health services, often for the first time. Additionally, many patients prefer utilizing telehealth for a variety of reasons. Reverting to the non-facility rate for telehealth services after the end of the COVID public health emergency will lead practitioners to offer telehealth less frequently or to restrict the number of Medicare beneficiaries they treat using telehealth.<br/><br/>Expand Psychology Training and Workforce Development<br/>Supervision by Psychologists <br/>I applaud CMS' Proposed Revisions to the "Incident to" Physicians' Services Regulation for Behavioral Health Services to allow for reimbursement for Physicians and Non-Physician Providers (NPPs), which include psychologists, who supervise these practitioners in their everyday practice. This will help expand access to and coordination of mental health services in rural and underserved areas where masters'-level practitioners represent a substantial segment of the mental health providers in the area.<br/><br/>Advanced Psychology Trainee Services <br/>I urge CMS to allow for Medicare reimbursement of services provided by advanced psychology trainees under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. Although psychology interns receive extensive clinical experience prior to their internship, services provided by trainees under the supervision of a licensed psychologist are not reimbursable under Medicare. Without Medicare reimbursement of services provided by trainees, training programs lack a steady source of funding. <br/><br/>Support the Psychological Research-to-Practice Pipeline<br/>Caregiving Behavior Management Training<br/>I ask CMS to reconsider its position on the caregiver behavior management training codes. There is extensive empirical support for caregiver behavior management training and it is the gold standard treatment approach for several health behavior issues. Although the patient is not present when this training is provided, these codes have many benefits for the patient, including a reduction in disruptive and problematic behaviors for children with ADHD, improved weight management for individuals with obesity, and better management of patients with dementia.<br/><br/>Digital Therapeutics<br/>I urge CMS to accept APA Services' proposal that would establish a new set of reimbursement codes for digital therapeutics-one for purchase of the device, one for patient education about the device, and two for ongoing management of the service furnished through the device.  Unlike the RTM codes, this structure reimburses for an active therapeutic intervention, as opposed to passively monitoring a patient's condition. A new set of reimbursement codes as outlined above will have a positive impact on access to treatment amongst patients who have limited access to traditional office-based treatment or who prefer the use of digital devices over a face-to-face visit.

INFO - Comment: Tuesday, January 28, 2014<br/><br/>Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center<br/>Environmental Protection Agency<br/>Mailcode: 2822T<br/>1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW.<br/>Washington, DC 20460<br/><br/>Subject: Stay on the Road to Better Biofuels -- Renewable Fuel Standard Program; 2014 Standards (Docket ID: EPA-HQ-OAR-2013-0479-0037)<br/><br/>Dear Administrator McCarthy,<br/><br/>I strongly support the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and its smart goals of cutting oil use and reducing global warming emissions from transportation. The RFS is also structured to move the biofuels industry in the right direction, toward biofuels not made from food.<br/><br/>"A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise."<br/>-- Aldo Leopold<br/><br/>I am encouraged to see that the Environmental Protection Agency's 2014 proposal reduces the overall biofuels requirements to address current challenges, such as the slower than expected ramp-up of cellulosic biofuels, and the well-known challenges presented by food-based biofuels. But, while slowing down to a realistic growth plan is warranted, the 2014 proposal goes too far, threatening to stifle investment in the growing cellulosic biofuels industry just as these cleaner fuels are starting to come online.<br/><br/>"To waste, to destroy, our natural resources, to skin and exhaust the land instead of using it so as to increase its usefulness, will result in undermining in the days of our children the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand down to them amplified..."<br/>-- Theodore Roosevelt <br/><br/>Furthermore, as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) responds to the near-term challenges to effective biofuels policy, I urge you not to lose sight of the essential long-term goal: cutting oil use and global warming emissions by expanding production of better, non-food biofuels. The EPA should update the long-term roadmap for the RFS to provide the stability needed to ultimately deliver on its oil saving and climate goals.<br/><br/>"As we peer into society's future, we--you and I, and our government--must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow."<br/>-- Dwight D. Eisenhower<br/><br/>I therefore urge the EPA to take a two-prong approach: modify your 2014 proposal to ensure that the supply of cellulosic biofuels continues to grow, and quickly finalize these revised 2014 targets. In addition, the EPA should open a separate process to look at long-term issues around biofuels and food prices, trade, land use, climate, and fuel distribution infrastructure.<br/><br/>"Then I say the Earth belongs to each generation during its course, fully and in its own right, no generation can contract debts greater than may be paid during the course of its own existence."<br/>-- Thomas Jefferson<br/><br/>A smart plan for 2014, coupled with a realistic long-term roadmap, will keep us on the path to a cleaner fuel future.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of my comments. Please do NOT add my name to your mailing list. I will learn about future developments on this issue from other sources.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Christopher Lish<br/>Olema, CA

Under current policy, low-income adults without children or disability can receive SNAP benefits up to three months. Trump's Department of Agriculture wants to reduce that already short time, making low-income people already struggling to find work even more vulnerable to hunger.

While the proposed rule is 'voluntary' today, we know that this is only the first step to being mandatory.  Please reject this proposed regulation.<br/><br/>Individuals should have the right to support charities and causes they believe in. Requiring individuals to provide their social security numbers would put the individual at increased risk of identity theft, along with other risks associated with compromised privacy.  <br/><br/>Let us not forget that the IRS engaged in systematic targeting of organizations, charities, and individuals whose beliefs and missions did not align with this current administration's agenda. Requiring donors to give social security numbers when they donate to charitable organizations would make it that much easier for the IRS to subject donors to additional scrutiny, audits, and other forms of abuse.  <br/><br/>The proposed regulation is unnecessary, unhelpful, and will undoubtedly comprise Americans' privacy.

INFO - Comment: To whom it may concern:<br><br><br/><br/>I am writing to encourage the Department of the Interior to move forward with a robust oil and natural gas leasing program for the Gulf of Mexico. While I understand there has been some progress on new lease sales, it's up to the Department to ensure we are fully developing the resources we have here at home to meet the energy needs of our fellow citizens.<br><br><br/><br/>I am particularly concerned that one of the Department's options is moving forward with no new additional lease sales over the next 5 years. This would be devastating for a region that produces more than 15% of America's oil. One estimation determined a 5-year lapse in lease could mean 885,000 fewer barrels of oil per day by 2036. If we think the cost of energy is bad now, I can only imagine what it would be if we fell even further behind in domestic production.<br><br><br/><br/>The Department of the Interior is charged with responsibly managing our public lands and waters. This means balancing environmental protection and resource development. Fortunately, the oil and natural gas produced in the Gulf of Mexico has some of the lowest carbon-intensity in the world. Not to mention, U.S. environmental standards are far superior to many oil-producing regions in the world.<br><br><br/><br/>You have the opportunity to increase American energy production at a time in which we desperately need it - and do it responsibly.

INFO - Comment: I staunchly support the implementation of the USDA's proposed Organic Livestock & Poultry Standards rule. This set of requirements for the raising of chickens, turkeys, pigs, cows, sheep and other livestock on organic farms would vastly improve welfare for those animals, making sure they have meaningful access to the outdoors and the ability to engage in natural behaviors. It also ensures animals are not subject to certain unnecessary and painful mutilations and have more protections at the end of their lives during transport and at slaughter. <br/><br/>Importantly, the rule would align practices on organic farms with consumer expectations. Studies show that concern for animal welfare is one of the top reasons consumers choose organic meat, milk, cheese and eggs, and most assume the organic program ensures animals have meaningful access to the outdoors. Consumers consistently report that they're willing to pay more for higher-welfare products. It is well past time to ensure that consumers are receiving the higher welfare-products they're seeking when they buy organic.<br/><br/>I thank the USDA for proposing this rule and urge the agency to swiftly advance a final rule that will require organic producers to start complying with these improved standards as quickly as possible.

I completed a DOL registered training program - one created by a partnership between the IBEW and its contractor association, the National Electrical Contractors Association. While in school I also had hands on, on the job training. I earned while I learned and had benefits. I graduated with a profession, debt free. I am extremely thankful for the opportunities that have come my way as a result of my completion of an apprenticeship program. I am thankful for the opportunity to comment on your proposal, because I want the U.S. apprenticeship system to remain strong.<br/><br/>Completing the IBEW/NECA apprenticeship has allowed me to support my family. While I was an apprentice, I was able to support my family, I was paid a wage and benefits that allowed my family to be financially comfortable. The classroom training was hard, so it was very helpful that I was able to earn while I learned - it took some stress out of my life that allowed me to focus on studying. I am glad you have decided to exempt the construction industry - this exemption should be permanent. It concerns me that apprentices enrolled in IRAPs would be paid minimum wage. I would assume these apprentices in a lot of cases would need to pick up a second job and I know with the intensity of my classes and work, I would not have been able to do that and successfully complete my program. IRAPs on the surface may seem like an okay idea, but as someone who has completed a program, I don't think they're a good idea - especially not in the construction industry.<br/><br/>Excluding construction from Industry Programs is a no-brainer. Preserving the registered apprenticeship program will ensure that future apprentices get the training they will need to work on the complex construction projects that are necessary to rebuild America's infrastructure.<br/><br/>Michael Mertes<br/>Yorkville, Illinois

INFO - Comment: Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>Dear Tracy Stone-Manning,<br/><br/>I commend the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Department of Interior, and the Biden administration for proposing long-needed updates to the oil and gas leasing on our federal public lands. Today's federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>Applying the rule's &quot;leasing criteria&quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &quot;speculative leasing.&quot; Our country's current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating non-competitive leasing, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing - whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets - be excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation.<br/><br/>The BLM's new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule's implementation of increased fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, as mandated by recent legislation to bring those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and minimum lease bid be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2032. I also request that the BLM require a higher royalty rate in 2032 to ensure taxpayers continue receiving a fair share from the industry's development of publicly-owned resources.<br/><br/>America's public lands and waters belong to all of us and we all have an interest in using them wisely. These lands are the economic foundation for local communities, businesses, and economies across the West. Reforming the federal oil and gas leasing system is necessary to balance development and conservation responsibly and ensure that recreation resources are prioritized and maintained to meet today's needs, challenges, and opportunities.<br/><br/>We are counting on the Biden administration to listen to the public and finalize the strongest possible reforms as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr Lonnie Sheinart<br/>CA

But in reality, offshore drilling leases take years before they produce any oil, so they do nothing to bring down the price of gas at the pump today. <br/><br/>Instead, new offshore drilling leases can lock-in long-term fossil fuel infrastructure thats inconsistent with our efforts to solve climate change and pose huge risks to the health of communities, workers, and wildlife. We must put in policies today that will help limit the warming of the earth for decades to come and center frontline and coastal communities who already bear the brunt of climate change burdens. <br/><br/>The climate bill recently signed into law was historic, but it was also a compromise that included troubling provisions seeking to advance oil and gas drilling on public lands and waters. The fact is, there should be no new oil and gas leasing. Thats why Im calling on the Department of Interior to use every tool available to end new oil and gas lease sales, <br/><br/>We will continue to fight to ensure there is no new leasing in the final Five Year Plan in line with what science and justice require.

INFO - Comment: I’d like to submit my comment in support of the proposed rule issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) entitled Definition of “Engaged in the Business” as a Dealer in Firearms (Docket No ATF 2022R-17).   <br/><br/>The issue of background checks on firearm sales is important to me. <br/><br/>For years, firearm sellers exploited a loophole in federal law to sell guns without conducting background checks. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act included a provision to tackle this loophole. The proposed rule makes clear: if you are selling guns to make a profit, then you are presumed to be in the business of dealing in firearms. For that reason, you need to be licensed and run background checks on customers. <br/><br/>Completed background checks save lives, but loopholes in current law put everyone at risk. This new rule can improve the use of the background checks system by expanding who is legally required to conduct a background check on a firearm seller. <br/><br/>I believe the proposed rule is vital to keep our schools, homes, and communities safe. I strongly recommend ATF finalizes the proposed rule without delay.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Billie Derham<br/>

INFO - Comment: I am writing to express my opposition to the proposed rule (FWS-HQ-ES-2019-0115) to revise Endangered Species Act (ESA) critical habitat regulations.<br/><br/>I ask that you withdraw the proposal, which would undermine the use of critical habitat designations to recover species. The rule would reverse existing U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service policy that favors establishing critical habitat on federal land, the land owned by all of us. This about face on policy will hurt species that depend on federal lands, like the polar bear, northern spotted owl, and the Gunnison sage grouse. I fear that this change is intended to help those that would exploit and damage federal lands, like loggers and drillers, at the expense of imperiled species and our planets biodiversity. <br/><br/>The proposal would also tip the scales on cost-benefit analysis, giving much more weight to costs to extractive and harmful industries, while ignoring the benefits to species. We know that when we save nature, we save ecosystem services, we protect our environment and our health, and we protect future generations. And yet, this rule would put the immediate economic costs of just a handful of individuals and corporations ahead of all that  including my family and my community. I do not agree with this change and I urge you to withdraw this proposal. <br/><br/>Habitat loss is the biggest threat to imperiled species, which means critical habitat designations are one of the most important protections we can preserve for species on the brink of extinction. There are a million species at risk of extinction, and we should be doing all we can to save them, instead of undermining the ESA. This proposed rule will weaken our ability to protect species, and for that reason I oppose this proposed rule and urge you to withdraw it.

INFO - Title: Comment from Michele Bowling
INFO - Comment: Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D.<br/>U.S. Food & Drug Administration<br/><br/>Dear Commissioner Hahn:<br/><br/>I am a pet owner whose pet relies on compounded medications. I am concerned about the GFI #256 on animal drug compounding that was issued late last year. If finalized in its current form, this guidance would severely limit animal drug compounding from bulk ingredients and would interfere with the state-regulated practices of pharmacy and veterinary medicine and my animal may not be able to get the life-saving medication it needs. <br/><br/>I understand that GFI #256 is similar to a previous guidance, GFI #230, issued by FDA in 2015 that was withdrawn in 2017 after complaints from veterinarians, pharmacy organizations, pet owners like me, and even from Congress. I'm concerned that the issues giving rise to those complaints have not rectified in this new draft.<br/><br/>My concerns:<br/><br/> By requiring that FDA-approved manufactured drugs be used in animal compounding, this guidance is more stringent than Congress has authorized for humans. FDA has provided no data or justification for why compounds prepared using FDA-approved drugs are deemed safer than those prepared from bulk ingredients. The stipulation to compound only from manufactured drugs in animal compounding is not workable for several reasons, among them:<br/><br/>-Some compounders report they are unable to obtain FDA-approved drugs for compounding from manufacturers. The manufacturers refuse sell the drug for purposes of compounding. That will create access problems for me and my pet.<br/>-The FDA-allowed deviation from labeled potency of FDA-approved drugs can result in serious variances in potency of animal meds compounded from FDA-approved drugs. With bulk ingredients, the compounder knows the exact potency of the substance and is required by USP standards to do additional testing as well. That FDA would allow such deviation by requiring only FDA-approved drugs be used makes me worry for the safety of my pet.<br/>-Required use of FDA-approved drugs in animal compounding will significantly increase costs to pet owners like me because FDA-approved drugs almost always cost more - in many cases much more - than bulk ingredients.<br/><br/>The proposed guidance is an intrusion into the practice of veterinary medicine, impinging on veterinarians' medical judgment in determining what medication is best to treat my pet. The proposed guidance will force vets to document that a compounded drug produces a clinical difference in their animal patient and that there is medical rationale for the prescription -- a requirement not placed on other prescribers. In any other setting, the prescription itself serves as documentation of the veterinarian's determination of clinical need.<br/><br/>FDA's proposed positive list for bulk ingredients will severely restrict veterinarians' ability to obtain compounded medications to administer in-office even if state law allows it. This provision is particularly dangerous for animal health because veterinary clinics serve as hospitals and emergency rooms, and vets must have certain compounded medications available to meet immediate needs of animal patients. In addition, some vets must travel to the animal patient to provide treatment, and thus often need compounded medications on hand to administer on-site.<br/><br/>While I count on FDA to make sure that medications for my pet are safe, GFI #256  is not the way to do it. For these reasons, I respectfully request that the proposed guidance be withdrawn and that FDA work with veterinarians, compounding pharmacists, and pet owners like me to come up with workable guidance.

INFO - Comment: Secretary Robert A. McDonald <br/>US Department of Veterans Affairs<br/>810 Vermont Avenue, NW<br/>Washington, DC 20420-0001<br/><br/>Dear Secretary McDonald,<br/><br/>As a Nurse Practitioner, I am writing to express my support for the proposed rule [RIN: 2900-AP44 - Proposed Rule - Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (81 Fed. Reg. 33155, May 25, 2016)] which addresses the growing demand for health care services within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) by allowing our nation's veterans to have direct access to high quality health care delivered by Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), including nurse practitioners (NPs).  <br/><br/>As you know, over 6,000 APRNs, of which over 4,000 are NPs, currently provide a full range of services to our veterans in the VHA.  The safety of APRN services has long been recognized by the VHA and underscored by peer-reviewed scientific studies.  These studies have proven consistently that the care provided by APRNs, practicing to the full scope of their education and preparation, is equal to the care of their physician counterparts.  This large and ever growing body of evidence has led the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine), AARP, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the National Governors Association, and the Federal Trade Commission to encourage providing patients direct access to APRNs.   <br/><br/>Limiting APRN practice within the VHA impairs access to care, risks lengthening delays in health care delivery, increases healthcare costs, and fails to promote patient safety.  That is why I urge you to move forward with this proposed rule.  By finalizing and implementing this rule, we will be ensuring that our veterans receive timely, high quality health care.<br/><br/>Swift enactment of this policy update will provide veterans with direct access to the safe, high quality, patient-centered care that NPs have provided for more than 50 years. Thank you for your time and consideration on this important matter.

INFO - Comment: The Department of Energy bureaucrats need to acquaint themselves with America's founding documents.  They would discover the reason for the government's existence is to secure the unalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness that the people have been endowed with.  It does not exist to function as the strong arm of political ideology. It is sad and pathetic to see the U.S. Government descending into an authoritarian apparatus that more resembles totalitarian states, both past and present, than the citadel of liberty the founders sacrificed for.

INFO - Comment: I am writing to express my concerns regarding the Draft Environmental Assessment to reduce bird damage in the state of Indiana and advocate for Alternative 2 in your current proposal for addressing bird damage, or an alternative that requires all non-lethal strategies for damage mitigation to first be exhausted before any lethal action is taken.  <br/><br/>As Indiana Wildlife Services states in the Environmental Assessment, educational outreach efforts already include promoting coexistence between humans and wild animals and human behavior modification. This should be emphasized and prioritized in the plan that Wildlife Services chooses to move forward with. The agency could also help to fund and develop new infrastructure to protect against bird damage. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the agency should either proceed with Alternative 2 or create an alternative that requires all non-lethal methods to be used to their fullest extent before lethal action is taken. Wildlife Services should also commit to exploring long-term, non-lethal solutions that promote harmony between humans and wild animals.<br/><br/>Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I trust that you will take into account the importance of preserving diverse bird populations through responsible and compassionate wildlife management.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Luciana Redolfi

INFO - Comment: I write today to urge the Council on Environmental Quality to withdraw and rewrite the guidance on consideration of greenhouse gas emissions for the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). I am deeply concerned about the climate crisis and the threats it poses to humans and vast natural areas, particularly our national parks. Eighty per cent of our national parks are suffering significantly from the harms posed by the warming of our planet and July was the hottest month ever recorded in human history. When Congress passed NEPA, it did so with the intention that future generations may live on this planet in productive and enjoyable harmony with the environment.<br/><br/>But this NEPA guidance does not acknowledge the severity of the climate crisis and fails in numerous ways to give the necessary direction to agencies and the public to adequately address greenhouse gas emissions at the magnitude befitting of the crisis we face. The guidance does not acknowledge that climate change is relevant to virtually all federal decisions. It fails to instruct agencies to evaluate the latest science and does not identify clear requirements to lessen climate impacts to projects or consider reasonable mitigation measures. Our federal government has a responsibility to protect future generations from intrinsic threats such as climate change, yet this draft guidance fundamentally fails to recognize the intended purpose of NEPA and the gravity of the climate crisis.<br/><br/>For the sake of our future and the future of special places like national parks that we love, cherish and enjoy, please reconsider and rewrite this guidance.

INFO - Comment: Veterans deserve the best care possible, not a lower standard of care than that provided to other patients. In fact, almost all states have a requirement in place assuring physician involvement in anesthesia.  VA should not remove physician anesthesiologists from Veterans' surgical care team. The Final Rule should explicitly reflect VA's stated position: the current team-based model of anesthesia care is serving Veterans safely and effectively.  VA's own patient safety research found there is reason to doubt the safety of anesthesia without physician involvement. Please join with the public, Veterans, the VA's own anesthesia experts and Veteran organizations, all of whom support preserving physician-led, team-based anesthesia care in VA.
