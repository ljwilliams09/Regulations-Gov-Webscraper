INFO - Comment: As a Staff / Board member  of the AZA accredited Louisville Zoo in Kentucky, I would like to express my strong support for the conservation effort by the Dallas Zoo, Sedgwick County Zoo and Omaha Henry Doorly Zoo to help balance the environment in Swaziland by importing and providing new homes for 18 Swaziland elephants at these US Zoos.  This partnership with the Kingdom of Swaziland Wildlife Management Authority will support the welfare of the  elephants and critically endangered rhinos in Africa as well.  These elephants would become part of the North American population managed by zoos which are accredited by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums (AZA) and will help to reduce the number of elephants in Swazilands parks to sustainable levels while lessening competition for the limited resources available to African elephants and rhinos in the area.  Relocation within the region is not favorable due to excessive poaching, loss of habitat, and significant drought conditions.  If not relocated, these magnificent creatures will be culled. Each partner zoo has the resources to provide the elephants with wonderful new homes, proper nutrition and excellent veterinary care.  In addition, the ongoing support for Swazilands in-situ rhino conservation program by the partner zoos will contribute to the survival of the rhinos.  AZA zoos support research and maintain partnerships that educate the public. This public awareness is key to the conservation of many endangered species including African elephants and rhinos. <br/>

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Azar,<br/><br/>I write to comment on the proposed rule on Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  The previous administrations expansion of the definition of sex in this section to include gender identity could have tragic repercussions if it were ever implemented.  I am glad to see you clarifying that sex should be defined by its ordinary meaning.<br/><br/>Though it supports the ideology of gender identity, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) understands the binary nature of sex and the need for the distinction. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) the APA defines sex as the Biological indication of male and female (understood in the context of reproductive capacity), such as sex chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, and nonambiguous internal and external genitalia.<br/><br/>If doctors and scientists treated patients without considering their biological makeup patient outcomes would suffer. Just recently, a woman lost her baby because she presented to the hospital as male and her symptoms werent properly diagnosed.<br/><br/>Additionally, this change is consistent with the rest of the Trump Administration and Congressional interpretation.  In October of 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a memo to all United States Attorneys and heads of department components regarding employment sex discrimination cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  This memo states that "Sex is ordinarily defined to mean biologically male or female. . . . . Congress has confirmed this ordinary meaning [] in several other statutes[.] Congress has repeatedly declined to enact legislation to include gender identity in the definition of sex in various areas of nondiscrimination law and any such change should be the prerogative of Congress, not the agencies.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Belinda Kangombe

INFO - Comment: As an individual concerned about ensuring that patients have access to accurate and reliable laboratory test results, I am writing in response to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Jan. 9, 2018 Request for Information pertaining to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) regulations. I am opposed to the Agency's flawed policy that a bachelor's degree in nursing is equivalent to a bachelor's degree in the biological sciences, as well as its proposal to list nursing "as a separate qualifying degree...for purposes of meeting the educational requirements for moderate and high complexity testing personnel and technical consultants."<br/><br/>A bachelor's degree in nursing is NOT equivalent to a biological sciences degree, and it does not provide academic instruction sufficient to perform or supervise non-waived laboratory testing. A biological sciences degree may require 60 semester hours or more of biological and chemical sciences-much of it upper level-whereas a nursing degree typically requires fewer than 15 semester hours of biological and or chemical science-most of which tends to be introductory/survey level. As a degree, it is insufficient to provide the necessary scientific knowledge and training in non-waived laboratory procedures. <br/><br/>Unless a bachelor's degree is substantially equivalent in terms of its course load and level and related laboratory training/experience, it should not allow its holder to perform high complexity testing or supervise non-waived laboratory testing. While I am aware of workforce shortages in the laboratory, these should not be solved by employing individuals from another health care discipline that has its own shortage situation. Patient safety demands quality laboratory testing performed by qualified individuals.<br/><br/>I urge you to "Put Patients First" by not allowing the nursing degree to satisfy CLIA's high complexity educational requirements.<br/><br/>Sincerely,

INFO - Comment: National Marine Fisheries Service    Dear National Marine Fisheries Service,  I'm deeply concerned about the impact of your agency's fishery management decisions on ocean ecosystems. I believe that strong environmental review is critical to the health of our oceans. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has made it possible to protect thousands of square miles of deep sea coral formations, save the lives of endangered sea turtles and begin rebuilding of depleted fish populations.   Unfortunately your agency's proposed NEPA rule hands over too much authority to fishery management councils that have a long history of poor management, significantly limits the public's ability to participate in fishery management decisions, and allows fishery managers to make decisions about fishing without fully considering the impacts on marine ecosystems including sea turtles, seals, corals and other precious ocean life.  Please withdraw this flawed NEPA proposal and craft a new one that will ensure protection of our ocean ecosystems. Our oceans are in trouble. I've seen in my own life how decades of mismanagement have degraded the oceans. It's time for our nation's fisheries managers to make better decisions by fully understanding the consequences of fishing on marine ecosystems.   Thank you for your time and consideration.

INFO - Comment: Dr. James Kendall,<br/> <br/>I urge the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to stop preparing for a lease sale in the Beaufort Sea in 2019. The current five-year offshore leasing program does not allow for new lease sales in the Beaufort Sea. Preparing for a new lease sale at this point is premature and indicates that BOEM has pre-determined the outcome of planning process it is currently undertaking for 2019?2024?even though a new program is still in its initial stages.<br/> <br/>There is no compelling reason to rush to sell leases in the Beaufort Sea. In recent years, oil companies have walked away from investments there. Moreover, drilling in these waters could cause enormous damage. A major oil spill could have severe consequences and would be all but impossible to clean up. Even routine oil and gas operations create noise, air and water pollution, and they generate air and vessel traffic that can have serious consequences.<br/> <br/>If BOEM continues to consider a 2019 Beaufort Sea lease sale, it should exclude offshore areas with particularly important biological or cultural importance. These areas include the Barrow Canyon area, the region between Oliktok Point and Demarcation Bay, Smith Bay, the Harrison Bay?Colville Delta region, and the Beaufort shelf break. In addition, BOEM should heed requests to exclude areas that are important for subsistence hunting.<br/> <br/>Sincerely,

INFO - Comment: <br/>As a physician anesthesiologist, I believe all patients, especially Medicare patients, deserve high-quality care. This is why I strongly urge the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure that the requirement of physician involvement in the anesthesia care of Medicare patients is reinstated.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE), CMS issued a temporary waiver of the Medicare requirement of physician anesthesiologists in anesthesia care to prepare for potential shortages of physician providers.  Unfortunately, this was done without substantial justification; the pandemic does not necessitate this policy change because the existing supervision rule already provides for flexibility, deferring to state Governors to opt-out of the requirement if necessary. There have been no demonstrated shortages of anesthesia providers, and states have rescinded early waivers noting that the elimination of physician involvement related to anesthesia care serves no purpose. Further, replacing physician anesthesiologist-led care does not create any cost savings nurse anesthetists and physician anesthesiologists bill Medicare the same amount.<br/><br/>As the public health emergency continues, physicians and all providers on the front lines know that the Medicare waiver is unnecessary.  We have seen that COVID-19 has reinforced the need for team-based anesthesia and critical care services as their expertise and training is critical to the care of COVID-positive patients.  Covid-19 can cause serious lung and breathing problems in patients of all ages; one of the key roles of an anesthesiologist during surgery is to maintain a patient's breathing.  Older patients infected with COVID-19 are some of the most complex and challenging cases a physician will see in their career.  Now is not the time to take the physician away from patients.<br/><br/>Any attempt to permanently remove physician involvement in anesthesia care is dangerous and lowers the standard of care. Many Medicare patients have conditions that put them at higher risk during surgery. While the nurse-only model of care may be appropriate for other health care settings such as primary care, it is not a safe approach for Medicare beneficiaries in the acute, critical, and perioperative care settings, where life-threatening situations occur unpredictably. It is these instances where a physician's significant training and education is required for accurate diagnosis and successful intervention. When seconds count, you want a medical doctor leading a patient's care, not a nurse.<br/><br/>Medicare patients deserve to have access to the highest quality, team-based model of anesthesia care to ensure their safety. I urge you preserve the current Medicare anesthesia safety standard.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>Dr. Venkat R. Mangunta Missouri

INFO - Comment: I am writing as a responsible tobacco retailer in Texas to oppose the proposed ban on licensed retailers selling menthol cigarettes to adults 21 and older.  I am proud of the work we do every day to make sure menthol cigarettes and other tobacco products are sold only to adults 21 and older.  Please do not move forward with this unfair proposal that could harm tobacco retailers across the United States by shifting many of these products to illegal sellers that don't care who they sell to or how they do it.<br/><br/>If implemented, this proposal could hurt retailers and wholesalers in the U.S. and directly impact my bottom line.  This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue; menthol cigarettes alone make up 36% of all cigarette sales in the United States.   Additionally, adult customers who purchase menthol cigarettes also purchase gas, food, and other items that my store depends on.<br/><br/>It makes no sense to end the sale of these products through licensed retail stores like mine.  Bans could shift sales to illegal markets where many consumers can still get them, but without any regulatory protection or underage prevention. Flavor bans create illegal markets that could endanger the public with bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access, crime, arrests, and community conflict.<br/><br/>Underage use of menthol cigarettes is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21 -- not with bans that create illegal markets.  Responsible, licensed retailers like me have worked hard to comply with age-verification requirements, and these efforts are a big reason why underage rates have fallen so low.<br/><br/>I respectfully urge you to reconsider a ban on menthol cigarettes, and instead focus on more positive solutions that respect the role of responsible, legal businesses like mine.  Instead of banning products for adults, the government should be giving adult smokers more information and choices for lower risk tobacco products -- as well as continuing to focus on underage prevention and education.<br/>

This change has serious implications for acupuncturists and my ability to prescribe medications my patients need for their health care. Homeopathy is in the scope of practice of all licensed physicians in the U.S., while three states specifically license homeopathic physicians, and 24 states explicitly include it in the scope of practice of licensed naturopaths and/or acupuncturists. The Draft Guidance is affecting my ability to access homeopathic medicines and conflicts with states' authority over the practice of medicine.<br/><br/>Therefore, I urge you to adopt a policy that adheres to the law either by A) implementing the regulatory framework offered in a currently pending Citizen Petition submitted in June 2020 by Americans for Homeopathy Choice, a consumer organization whose goals I support, or by B) rescinding the Draft Guidance and working with stakeholders on a policy that does not subvert the regulatory process, which is intended to allow the affected public to have a role in shaping new regulations and have access to the courts to challenge them once adopted.

Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning flavored cigars could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since flavored cigars alone generate $4 to $5 billion in annual retail sales and make up 37% to 47% of popular price large cigars sold in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of flavored cigars could undermine my ability to operate by impacting my revenue. <br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, sales of flavored cigars could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime in many states.    Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of flavored cigars is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.  <br/>

Larger, older trees are also far more fire resistant, and a well-constructed rule would not preclude necessary, science-based efforts to address the risk of fire.   <br/><br/>Unfortunately, vital mature forests and trees on federal lands are currently threatened by numerous proposed and ongoing logging projects, in spite of President Biden’s executive order to conserve them. We need to ensure America's mature and old-growth trees and forests remain in place to mitigate climate change, and to maintain their natural benefits for future generations. Thank you for your leadership on these important issues.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Sara Brydges<br/>Concord, MA 01742<br/>sbrydges@comcast.net

INFO - Comment: I am writing to oppose your proposal to rescind the regulatory definition of “harm” under the Endangered Species Act. <br/><br/>Habitat destruction is the main driver of species decline. When Congress passed the Endangered Species Act, it explicitly recognized the importance of habitat in protecting and restoring endangered species. And the definition of harm you seek to delete was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court 30 years ago. If anything, the case for habitat protection under the ESA has grown even stronger since then, with mountains of scientific evidence linking habitat and species’ survival.   <br/><br/>There is no rational reason to rescind this definition; rescission only serves as an invitation to timber, oil, mining and other extractive industries, as well as the government and individuals, to try to destroy habitat that endangered species need to live, eat, and raise their young. Common sense, science, and the ESA itself tells us that habitat destruction harms species.  <br/><br/>Just one company or project can destroy habitat, but when a species disappears, we all suffer the consequences, which can include impacts to our food and water supply, to industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to tourism, and to our cultural and spiritual values.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>John Ouellette<br/>Manchester, NH

The 2017 rule included provisions that would disallow the industry to continue to self-police with the use of DQPs, and ban the use of chains and other action devices used to sore horses. <br/> <br/>Over 100,000 public comments were submitted on the proposed rule, while hundreds of members of Congress also wrote in support.<br/> <br/>The USDA must act expediently to end this cruelty, which continues to plague the Tennessee walking horse industry and affect other gaited breeds. <br/><br/>I do not support withdrawing this rule without the introduction of new regulations to ban soring and hope a rule will be quickly introduced that incorporates new information, including recommendations found in the 2021 National Academies of Science report, “Review of Methods for Detecting Soreness in Horses.”<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Miss Darelyn Haynes

INFO - Title: Comment from Litman, Laurie
INFO - Comment: I urge the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries to rescind in full the 2019 Trump-era regulations that severely weakened protections for our nation’s most imperiled animals and plants. These changes represented the most significant rollbacks to the Endangered Species Act in the law’s 50-year history and pushed hundreds of species closer to the brink of extinction.  <br/> <br/>It is extremely disappointing that this proposed rule retains a number of harmful provisions governing the responsibility of federal agencies to avoid jeopardizing protected species or adversely modifying their critical habitat. In particular, it retains a definition of “adverse modification” that requires federal actions to affect species’ critical habitat “as a whole” before real habitat protections are put in place. This is especially harmful for species like the northern spotted owl, polar bear or gulf sturgeon that have large critical habitat designations but are still at risk of extinction. The provision ignores the basic fact that the single largest driver of extinction here and around the world is habitat loss and allows the Services to turn a blind eye to the vast majority of actions that harm critical habitat.  <br/> <br/>The proposed rule also retains the Trump-era definition of “environmental baseline,” which lets federal agencies off the hook for past harms to endangered species from things like dam or highway construction by deeming these projects part of the baseline. It absolves the agencies of much responsibility for the damage caused by interrelated actions they facilitate, such as urban growth from highway expansion or increased global warming from emissions related to federal oil and gas leasing.  <br/> <br/>The remaining Trump-era regulations that the agencies are proposing to retain — including the criteria for not prudent determinations for critical habitat — are equally problematic and will continue to put endangered species at greater risk of extinction. Thus, I urge the Services to rescind them in their entirety without exception. <br/> <br/>There are some aspects of the proposed rule that I support. I am grateful that the Biden administration plans to restore the “blanket 4(d) rule,” which will restore protections for threatened species. I also support reinserting the provision that prohibits consideration of economic impacts when deciding to protect species, as well as the provision that removes barriers to designate critical habitat for climate-impacted species.  <br/><br/>However, while the proposed rule restores some pieces of the Endangered Species Act regulations, it is wholly inadequate and represents a huge missed opportunity to make meaningful progress to recover our most vulnerable animals and plants on the 50th anniversary of the Act’s passage.  <br/> <br/>With time running out, we can’t afford more of the status quo. Combating the global wildlife extinction crisis will require the Services to be bolder and more visionary than any other administration in history. For these reasons, I urge the Services to not only rescind the Trump-era rollbacks in their entirety, but to also strengthen the implementation of the Endangered Species Act to avert the extinction crisis and curtail the ongoing loss of biodiversity in the United States and around the world.

Please do not move forward with this proposal that will repeat the same mistakes of prohibition of alcohol and cannabis. <br/><br/>Banning menthol cigarettes unfairly limits adult choices for tobacco products that are already highly regulated and age-restricted. Youth usage rates of cigarettes are the lowest in a generation.  Adult tobacco consumers 21+ should be allowed to buy menthol cigarettes if they want to.<br/><br/>This proposed ban could create an illegal market outside of all regulatory controls, including effective measures to keep tobacco products away from kids. If this ban takes effect, selling once legal products will suddenly become criminal activity.   History tells us that bans don't work.  Effective regulation and education are better solutions than creating illegal markets and increasing crime.<br/><br/>Please do not ban the sale of menthol cigarettes in the United States.

INFO - Comment: Please accept my comments on BLM’s proposed Public Lands Rule.<br/><br/>• The rule encourages designating additional Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) on public lands, which I support.<br/><br/>• The rule would set up a “conservation leasing” system that allows private parties to lease public lands for conservation and restoration purposes. In reality, it doesn’t appear the rule will achieve any such benefit. Since the rule requires that conservation leases must allow all ongoing activities to continue—even if they are destructive uses like livestock grazing—any benefit from restoration that might accrue from the lease would be seriously diminished.<br/><br/>• Wilderness areas should be exempt from the conservation leasing program. Leasing public lands for any purpose commodifies those lands—since commercial enterprise is generally banned in Wilderness, leasing Wilderness for any purpose would likely violate the Wilderness Act.<br/><br/>• The conservation leases put a heavy emphasis on active intervention, manipulation, and restoration. Such heavy-handed management runs counter to the fundamental tenet of the Wilderness Act to let nature be, so the intended management of the leased lands poses a risk to Wilderness. This is yet another reason Wilderness areas should be off-limits for conservation leases.<br/><br/>• BLM should unequivocally state in the new rule that the overarching mandate for wilderness stewardship is to preserve each area’s "untrammeled" or "wild" character.<br/><br/>• In lieu of conservation leases in Wilderness, there should be a mechanism for permanent retirement of grazing permits in Wilderness and other sensitive areas. At a minimum, there should also be a non-use status for 10 years of grazing allotments in Wilderness that do not meet land health standards. It would be preferable for the permits to be revoked until recovery occurs.

Also referred to as the Public Lands Rule, the Bureau of Land Management's interest in establishing parity for conservation with various other uses of our public lands is a critical move for achieving real balance in management.<br/><br/>Given that the BLM is the steward of our largest public lands estate, managing more than 245 million acres, the result of this rulemaking process would greatly benefit hunters and anglers who rely on healthy, intact landscapes to pursue fish and game. Valuing conservation of intact habitat - including migration corridors - on par with other uses provides an unparalleled opportunity for the BLM at a time when intense drought, severe wildfires and encroaching invasive species threaten our public lands.<br/><br/>As proposed, this rule would promote critical restoration work by utilizing conservation leasing, a new tool for BLM to manage healthy public lands and accommodate more novel mitigation approaches. Targeted conservation leasing could help restore degraded and fragmented landscapes, increasing their resilience and improving the connectivity of migratory corridors.<br/><br/>I want to thank the BLM for its commitment to improving the management of our public lands and waters through this proposed rule, which will improve the conservation of fish and wildlife habitat for the benefit of hunters and anglers.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Acosta,<br/><br/>I write to comment and commend the Department of Labor (DOL) on the proposed rule by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCCP) Implementing Legal Requirements Regarding the Equal Opportunity Clauses Religious Exemption. As noted in the proposed rule, steps like these to protect churches and other faith-based employers, ensuring they have a level playing field with others, are nothing new. The Civil Rights Act was signed into law by President Johnson in 1964 and, in Title VII, regarding employment, Congress provided important protections for religious employers. Congress even broadened these protections about a decade later.<br/><br/>President Johnson understood the need to ensure that faith-based employers had a level playing field of access to and competition for grants and took this into account in Executive Order (EO) 11246 on federal contracting.<br/><br/>When the DOL was tasked with enforcing EO 11246 in 1978 it included Title VIIs exemption for religious educational institutions in its implementing regulations. In 2002 President Bush amended the EO by including Title VIIs exemption for religious organizations, which has since also been implemented by DOLs regulations.<br/><br/>It wasnt until the Obama administration that protections for faith-based employers were curtailed. The Trump administration DOL is reinvigorating these protections to their former status in line with, not only historical precedent, but recent decisions from the Supreme Court. For example, inTrinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, a church that ran a daycare center was denied access to a government grant program for nonprofit organizations to make their playgrounds safer for children, simply because they were a church. The Supreme Court made clear that Trinity Lutheran Church had just as much right to participate in the grant program as any other daycare center; their status as a church did not prevent them from playing an equal role in the public square. With this rule, the Trump administration DOL is simply affirming a principle the Supreme Court held to be squarely in line with the First Amendment by a 7-2 vote.<br/><br/>Religious liberty is a vital cornerstone of our nation. It is imperative that it is closely guarded and upheld. I commend the DOL for doing just that with this rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mrs. Sheilah Marshall

INFO - Comment: 2 comments:<br/>1) HH CAHPS: The accross the board requirement for 300 surveys per year is grossly disproportional for smaller agencies.  For example if you have 300 discharges per year you are reuiring that 100% of clients answer this survey whereas if you have 3000 clients it is only 10%.  Typically only 30% of people answer surveys.  This number needs to be a percentage of discharges not an across the board number.<br/>2) Face to Face encounters:  This is a huge burdeon for the sickest clients, those that are truely bedbound and the obese.  We have a clients who weigh over 700 pounds, they cannot get out, they do not fit on an ambulance stretcher, I do not know how we will meet this, the MD's do not do home visits either.  The other group are those that are elderly, cognitively disabled and bedridden that cannot get to the MD office any other way than by ambulance-this adds burdeon and expense for them and their caregivers.  many of these are on service for foley catheter changes and are seen 2 or 3 times a certification period only.

INFO - Comment: As a Catholic, I applaud efforts to ensure that pregnant women are supported throughout their pregnancy and have the resources necessary to raise healthy babies. We should all be working to build a society that stands with moms in need. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act was a major, bipartisan achievement toward that goal—an achievement made possible because Congress had the good sense to leave abortion out of it (as confirmed by senators who spoke on it at the time).<br/><br/>It is unconscionable that the EEOC is trying to corrupt this landmark law by interpreting it to require employers to grant accommodations for abortion, the complete opposite of supporting pregnancy, and not what Congress intended. I strongly urge the EEOC not to include abortion in its final regulations, and to enact a religious exemption that is more clear and robust than what is proposed and ensures that employers are not required to act contrary to their religious beliefs.<br/><br/>Democrats and Republicans were able to come together and do a good thing for pregnant women and their babies by passing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The EEOC should not sabotage their work by turning the law into an abortion-accommodating mandate.

Plus, when airlines know their fares will be listed next to their competitors, they will be more likely to offer a competitive price. <br/><br/>It's come to my attention that some airlines are trying to make it harder for me to see all my options by restricting certain websites from publishing fare and schedule information.

I hope you will see that my story is important, and you will make the needed changes. When I have some unexpected repairs that I need to make to my home, I use a pay day loan. Home repairs often can't wait, so I need to have the ability to get a quick loan.<br/> <br/>Unfortunately the cost of my insurance just went up so I needed to get a payday loan to help me cover some of the extra costs. Pay day loans are great for this sort of situation because they gave me time to reorganize my budget.<br/> <br/>I don't think the government should put a limit on the amount of days I can have a cash advance.  This rule would only restrict my access to a loan when I need it most.  If I can't get a loan from a payday loan store, I am worried my only option will be to get money from illegal lenders.<br/> <br/>Cash loans have been there for me in the past and I hope you change the proposed rule so I can continue to use them as I need to.<br/> <br/>

INFO - Comment: Hi-<br/><br/>All Americans benefit from our natural resources in the Gulf of Mexico, which supplies roughly 15% of the oil that helps power our country. That’s why the Department of the Interior needs to focus on producing a full 5-year leasing program and pushing forward with all potential lease sales, so that our country can continue to have a reliable source of energy and our economy can keep moving forward.<br/><br/>The current administration has only held one offshore lease sale at this point in 2022 by comparison, there were 3 sales within the first 500 days of the Obama Administration. Offshore leasing is a bipartisan priority, and it doesn’t make sense that DOI is holding up these important sales.<br/><br/>It’s common sense: America needs reliable, affordable energy, and a major step towards achieving that is developing robust offshore leasing plans. All 11 proposed leases should be put forward by Interior, as soon as possible, in order to provide a reasonable and predictable timeline for energy production.<br/><br/>The past few years have contained difficulties that many of us never could have expected a few years ago. From major conflicts abroad to a global pandemic, our economy has been stressed in many ways. We need to be building up our economic base, and that starts with the energy that comes from our offshore leases. Interior needs to fulfill its obligation to hold these sales, or our country’s economic recovery could be jeopardized. Presidents from both parties have made these sales a priority in the past. These lease sales will impact millions of Americans. Interior should keep that support in mind and move forward with all proposed lease sales over the next 5 years.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Jeff Chapman

Order No. 4714-2020) proposed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review and urge the agencies to rescind their proposal in its entirety. The proposed rule would deprive innumerable people with legitimate claims the ability to seek and obtain asylum in the U.S. It imposes insurmountable barriers at every stage of the asylum process that will be impossible for almost all asylum seekers to overcome. People with valid asylum claims will be unfairly turned away and returned to dangerous situations. If issued, the proposed rule would bring about an effective end to the countrys asylum system, inflict immeasurable harm, and deny protections to those most in need of safe haven. It would also represent the end to America's long, proud tradition of welcoming those seeking freedom and safety. <br/><br/>The proposed rule would prohibit many asylum claims arising out of gender-based harm. The proposed rule would allow blanket denials of claims arising out of gang violence and recruitment. The proposed rule would result in the denial of most asylum seekers through a transit ban. The proposed rule would deny asylum seekers a fair hearing. <br/><br/>The proposed rule would prohibit many asylum claims arising out of gender-based harm, affecting women, girls, and gender non-conforming people. The proposed rule's redefinition of political opinion would exclude those persecuted for trying to advance equal access to education, property ownership, employment, justice, and political representation. Persecution on the account of feminist or LGBTQ  advocacy would not be accepted by the U.S. <br/><br/>The rule especially targets asylum seekers from Central American countries, where gang warfare and violence have driven the region to have some of the highest homicide rates in the world. <br/><br/>If an asylum seeker transits through at least one other country without seeking asylum there first, they would likely be denied under this regulation. However, persecutors are known to follow survivors after they try to escape and some people, especially women and LGBTQ  individuals, may face threats to safety in a transit country, preventing safe harbor until arrival in the U.S. <br/><br/>Like in the criminal justice system, asylum seekers deserve to consult an attorney and make their case. This rule puts an impossible burden on asylum seekers to put together a case for protection at the very first step of their claim, most likely without legal representation and the means to gather the required evidence.<br/><br/>The proposed rule does not address how it would affect pending claims, which leaves current asylum seekers in a state of uncertainty. If the rule is applied to those with pending claims, it would unfairly punish individuals who have abided by the law. For example, the rule would render ineligible those who submitted their applications more than a year after arriving in the U.S, even though this is explicitly allowed under the Immigration and Nationality Act.<br/><br/>It goes against our Ameri <br/><br/>The proposed rule imposes barriers so high at every step of the asylum system that it would effectively shut the door to the vast majority of people fleeing persecution and undermine the United States' historical commitment to being a bastion of democracy and freedom from persecution. <br/><br/>Again, I urge the agencies to rescind this proposed rule.

As a registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist. I have worked for years with people living with obesity and diabetes. The common understanding in our culture and amongst healthcare professionals has been that people with obesity are overweight due to laziness or a lack of effort to reduce their weight. After over a decade of walking beside people in their journeys to lose weight, I can say with certainty that people with obesity can work incredibly hard to lose weight and still be unsuccessful. The reasons behind this are well documented in obesity research. Obesity is a chronic disease that, in the overwhelming majority of cases, cannot be effectively and sustainably addressed through effort alone. Medical treatment is needed. The burden placed on individuals who are denied access to obesity medications, which are now very effective, is a very heavy one. They face difficult to manage chronic diseases, joint pain, and discomfort navigating a world designed for thinner people. The burden on our healthcare system is similarly unbearable. In my work with people with diabetes, who have more access to the latest obesity medications as part of their diabetes treatment, I have seen amazing result over and over again - life-changing reductions in weight, vast improvements in quality of life, and risk factors for cardiovascular events and other diabetes complications drastically reduced. Please act to afford these benefits to people without diabetes living with obesity. This would not be the only step required to end the obesity epidemic, but it would be a major step in the right direction. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments to CMS.

INFO - Comment: Children are not at a risk for COVID like people with comorbidities, and it’s unconscionable to force vaccinate children when all the risks are not known, and sadly, as I see more and more deaths of babies from vaccinated mothers who breastfeed their babies, I have grave doubts about giving this to children.  The BLA approval given to the one Pfizer jab, with all its requirements to still report adverse reactions through 2027, does not give me a warm fuzzy about the use of this potentially dangerous gene therapy.  The mRNA and all it’s patents do not bode well for humans, and quite honestly, when you do not mandate these jabs for yourselves, your families, and everyone on your boards and such, how can you expect anyone to have any faith in the efficacy of these gene altering jabs?  Any recommendation or full approval you give will have ramifications to everyone who gets these jabs.  I often wonder why a vial from each batch isn’t given to an independent lab and tested for its purity of ingredients and to also be verified as not having anything in it that’s not listed in the ingredients listing.  It’s too bad that people in government positions can’t be held accountable for their bad decisions, especially when they recommend things that deprive people of their lives, livelihood, as well as activities of daily living.  Not knowing all the risks based on a person’s genetic flaws puts people at risks, and they have little to no recourse because everyone’s favorite excuse is, “it’s coincidental that it happened shortly after being vaccinated”.

This policy is an extension of a larger effort to tear families apart, and as an American, I find this policy absolutely shameful. New immigrants bring new ideas and energy to our nation. <br/><br/>Heres an important fact I urge the Department of Homeland Security to consider: one-third of U.S.-born citizens would struggle to pass this proposed public charge wealth test. This unjust rule would essentially put a price tag on green cards, turning our immigration system into one that heavily favors prospective immigrants with wealth, over those who seek upward mobility. The rule would warp a system that for centuries has brought millions of immigrants to our shores and has enriched our country and economy overall. <br/><br/>I identify strongly with my immigrant ancestors.  My father's grandparents immigrated here.  He was the first person in his family to finish high school.  I am the first to get a baccalaureate.  All of my family has contributed to the well-being of this country in a variety of ways.  All my great-grandfathers were, were itinerant farmers, a cross between migrant workers and sharecroppers.  They came here and built wonderful lives that really contributed to this country.  That's all immigrants want - to build good lives and contribute to the society that allows them to do that!<br/><br/>If this rule moves forward, no longer would we serve as a beacon for the worlds dreamers and strivers.

INFO - Comment: Dear Ms. Colangelo,<br/><br/>Hello from Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay Area! Thank you for the Service's proposal to revise the critical habitat designation for Florida manatees. The current critical habitat as designated for Florida manatees is 50 years old and must be updated to use the best available science to provide for the survival and recovery of the species. The proposed rule is an essential step in that direction.<br/><br/>To fully reflect the best available science and comply with the Endangered Species Act, however, I urge the Service to expand its proposal to include additional areas. This expansion is necessary to protect essential warm water sources and foraging habitat that manatees depend upon for their survival!<br/><br/>Please, I urge the Service to better address the industrial warm water sources that over half the Florida manatee population relies on during the colder winter months. Over the last several decades, manatees have become habituated to wintering at these artificial warm water discharges, and the number of manatees relying on power plant discharges has also increased during this time frame. Manatees depend upon these industrial discharges, which are essential to the species' survival and recovery, especially given dams and other impediments to manatees being able to access naturally flowing, reliable warm water sources.<br/><br/>I also urge the Service to reconsider its 30-kilometer radius to winter manatee aggregation areas. The best available science shows that a 50-kilometer radius more accurately covers manatee movements between essential warm water sites and proximate and necessary forage areas, allowing for connectivity between units. This expansion would include the Upper Mosquito Lagoon, which has been essential manatee foraging habitat during the ongoing unusual morality event.<br/><br/>Finally, the entirety of the Ocklawaha River into the St. Johns River should be included as critical habitat, connecting Units FL-11 and FL-12. This river is a major travel corridor for the species and provides access to several natural warm-water sites and foraging areas.<br/><br/>Again, I thank the Service for taking this important step to update protections for Florida manatee habitat. I urge you to expand the proposed rule in the final designation. Your proposal is essential for Wildlife Preservation and means so much to those of us who care about this species!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jane Elberti

INFO - Comment: VRBPAC – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?<br/>I urge VRBPAC members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of April 25, 2025, there have been 38,607 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. If VRBPAC is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing this ongoing, senseless threat to public health.

INFO - Comment: Im writing today to demand that the Department of Interior abandon the proposed rule (RIN 1024-AE38).<br/>The proposed rule seeks to repeal a common-sense 2015 rule that prohibited overly aggressive predator control practices on National Preserves in Alaska. <br/><br/>The 2015 rule banned unethical and barbaric practices such as killing mother bears and cubs at their den sites; baiting brown and black bears with pastries or other human foods; killing wolves and coyotes with pups during their denning season; shooting caribou from boats or shore as they cross lakes or rivers; and using dogs to hunt bears.<br/><br/>These practices are not permitted elsewhere in National Parks or Preserves and are not in keeping with the spirit or the language of the National Park Services directive to "provide for the maintenance of sound populations of, and habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens of Alaska and the Nation."<br/><br/>This proposed rule would overturn an existing 2015 NPS rule that is consistent with federal law and outlaws overly aggressive predator control practices on these preserves in Alaska. This 2015 rule was supported by scientists and thousands of Americans who commented in support of protecting predators from these cruel killing practices. <br/>

INFO - Comment: I support the proposed rule that would protect patients who rely on the Title X program for basic health care by ensuring they have access to the most qualified providers, including Planned Parenthood and other women's health centers. Title X is a critical, lifesaving program that provides access to cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, birth control, well-woman visits, and more. This is essential care. It's not optional. Many people choose to receive this care from the doctors and nurses they trust at Planned Parenthood health centers. For many others, Planned Parenthood health centers may be their only option for basic care. We can't let political agendas cut these women off from the care they need, and we can't let politicians ignore the laws that protect people's health care access. All people should be able to visit the health care providers they trust without interference from lawmakers. I applaud the Obama administration's new rule reinforcing existing protections for health care access, and I celebrate the positive impact it will have for people nationwide.

INFO - Comment: The Administration's new proposed rule does little to correct the underlying problems in its contraceptive mandate, which continues to violate many Americans' right of religious freedom. <br/><br/>The rule exempts only an extremely narrow set of religious employers, primarily "houses of worship."   Almost all private health plans must cover sterilization and all FDA-approved "contraceptives," including drugs that can cause abortion, as well as "education and counseling" promoting these to women and girls.  This coverage will be imposed "automatically" even on the employees of many religious organizations and their children.  Employers and employees will lose their right to seek health coverage that respects their values. I urge you to allow all organizations and individuals to offer, sponsor and obtain health coverage that does not violate their moral and religious convictions.

INFO - Comment: Dear Fish and Wildlife Service,<br/><br/>Thank you for undoing some of the Trump administration’s damage to critical Endangered Species Act regulations. I am heartened by many aspects of your proposed restoration. <br/><br/>However, there are multiple aspects of your proposed rules that are insufficient for the challenges that endangered wildlife are facing.  <br/><br/>First, you must go back to the drawing board and fully restore section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, which governs interagency consultation. For 50 years it's been established that the federal government should not engage in activities that could jeopardize species' survival or destroy habitat they need to survive and recover.  <br/><br/>Specifically, the Biden administration must rescind the addition of “as a whole” to section 402.02. This Trump-era language created an enormous loophole, inconsistent with the intent of the Endangered Species Act itself. The nefarious “as a whole” language is a free pass to destroy critical habitat as long as the total destruction of a species’ entire critical habitat is avoided. This is especially damaging for wide-ranging and migratory species, from piping plover to marbled murrelet, from salmon to lynx. This language also ignores the cumulative impact of different causes of habitat destruction over time. And it goes against the science-based establishment of critical habitat to ensure both the species survival and recovery, instead treating some areas of critical habitat as expendable.   <br/><br/>Additional definition changes from the Trump era that need to be reversed include one that creates unnecessary confusion when examining an agency action that is ongoing, or a continuation of past activities as opposed to something new (“environmental baseline” section 402.02).   <br/><br/>Additionally, you must reverse Trump’s damaging changes in section 424.11(e) that allow plants and animals to be prematurely delisted. It is essential that species recovery meets all science-based standards before removing the backstop of Endangered Species Act protections that have kept so many species alive.  <br/><br/>Each of the many changes to Endangered Species Act regulations made by the Trump administration weakened protections for threatened and endangered species at a time when we must be doing everything in our power to fight the biodiversity crisis and recover species from the brink of extinction. Despite the broad support for restoring and strengthening the rules that implement the Act, you’ve left multiple loopholes from the Trump-era rollbacks in place, which will undoubtedly jeopardize future efforts to protect wildlife and habitat. By failing to fully restore the Endangered Species Act rules, you've left a significant job less than half done. Now is the time to get this right; we have no more time to waste.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>kirby kenny<br/>2460 W 29th Ave Unit 406 Denver, CO 80211-4360

According to a 2015 survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality, 33% of respondents who sought health care in the last year experienced mistreatment during a visit to their health care provider, including violence. Nearly one-quarter avoided seeking health care when they needed it for fear of discrimination. Similarly, abortion stigma erects barriers to care.<br/><br/>If anti-discrimination protections for transgender patients are rolled back, it will be even more difficult for this community to access health care. And, removing protections for people who have had an abortion further stigmatizes health care.<br/><br/>We must stop politicizing health care so that every person can access the care that they need.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Tyler Schaub<br/>Ann Arbor, MI 48104

INFO - Title: Comment from Don Sidor
INFO - Comment: I strongly support discontinuing the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) general applicability waiver of Buy America for manufactured products. Since it was first approved in 1983, this outdated and extreme outsourcing loophole has sent billions in U.S. tax dollars offshore to purchase imported manufactured products that are critically necessary for our nation’s public works infrastructure, forsaking American manufacturers and their workers in the process. FHWA’s 40-year-old waiver has been a missed opportunity to strengthen our manufacturing base, ensure our essential infrastructure is resilient, and galvanize our economic and national security.<br/><br/>Recent supply chain disruptions – for everything from medical supplies to semiconductors – make unavoidably clear the federal government must do everything in its power to restore our industrial base and reduce our dependency on unreliable foreign sources for our infrastructure and national security needs. The U.S. Department of Transportation can do its part by fully implementing the “Build America, Buy America” Act (BABA), which ensures that all federally assisted infrastructure use iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials that are produced in the United States. The manufactured products general waiver was poorly justified when it was issued by FHWA in 1983 and is completely at odds with public policy today. Considering recent events, it cannot reasonably be argued to be in the taxpaying public’s interest to continue America’s reliance on foreign suppliers, including geopolitical adversaries. To the contrary, it is clearly in the public’s interest that FHWA adhere to the clear directives in the 1982 Buy America law and the newly enacted BABA rather than prolonging outdated waivers that send U.S. tax dollars offshore.<br/><br/>After decades of bad public policy that have encouraged outsourcing – including FHWA’s waiver of Buy America for manufactured products – It should not be a surprise that our industrial base has gaps where waivers will be necessary to overcome short-term market limitations. Yet, this is not an excuse for FHWA to continue its general waiver for manufactured products. Instead, DOT should only issue Buy America waivers when necessary and they should be narrow, transparent, and time limited. Providing detailed information on these supply chain gaps to the public through a transparent waiver process will create powerful market signals that will drive new private sector investments – making our country stronger and more secure.<br/><br/>Forty years is enough, and it is time for this massive outsourcing loophole to be closed.  Prolonging the manufactured products waiver will only result in billions more U.S. tax dollars needlessly sent abroad, strengthening other countries manufacturing sectors and deepening our dependencies on unreliable countries like China and Russia. Fortunately, DOT has already started working to take down this more than 40-year-old waiver with its plan to begin applying Buy America to electric vehicle chargers. DOT should keep the momentum by discontinuing its general applicability waiver of Buy America for manufactured products.

The workforce shortages experienced by the industry are at an all time high. Competition is fierce and we are already struggling to recruit qualified staff. Reducing our funding will further exacerbate our staffing challenges, which will have a direct impact on the quality of care delivered within our communities. Furthermore, imposing an unfunded minimum staffing mandate is going to add to our workforce challenges. To support such an idea, funding needs to be provided to providers to recruit and retain the workforce required to meet the proposed standards. Every facility in the nation is desperately trying to build their workforce. The staffing levels in facilities are not because of lack of trying. It is because we lack the funding and resources needed to address the workforce shortage. Imposing a minimum staffing level without any funding will not help resolve any of the workforce issues we are facing. Please focus on funding and solutions that help improve workforce and quality of care, not make it more difficult to achieve. Thank you for in reviewing my comment. <br/><br/>Brady Allen

But loopholes in the system—like the ones that allow unlicensed gun sellers to sell guns online and at gun shows without running background checks on their buyers—undermine it.<br/><br/>That’s why ATF’s proposed rule is so important and should be finalized. It will help close loopholes in our background check system that have, for decades, been exploited by bad actors like gun traffickers, straw purchasers, and other prohibited persons, including domestic abusers and convicted felons.<br/><br/>I support the proposed rule because it makes clear that firearms dealing can take place wherever and through whatever medium guns are bought and sold—whether that’s at a gun show or an online marketplace—and that certain conduct, like selling guns of the same or similar kind and type, constitutes firearms dealing. That means that these gun sellers will need to become licensed dealers and, as licensed dealers, run background checks.<br/><br/>The proposed rule won't just expand background checks and strengthen our background check system, but it will also save lives. That’s why I support the proposed rule and why I encourage ATF to finalize it.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Thea Whitehead

INFO - Comment: The American Medical Association (AMA) appreciates the opportunity to offer our comments on the Federal Data Strategys draft practices as contemplated by the Presidents Management Agendas Cross-Agency Priority Goal of Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset. While we understand that the Federal Data Strategy is intended to provide a framework for federal agencies, we believe that the principles and themes enclosed below are important to consider in any discussion related to privacy and security of sensitive information, such as the data maintained by physicians. <br/><br/>The AMA urges policy makers to ensure consistency and communication across agencies as they develop and implement confidentiality protections and best practices. As the use of digital health tools increase across health care, physicians must stay abreast of numerous privacy and security requirements. While physicians are covered entities under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and are therefore subject to HIPAAs requirements, penalties, and enforcement actions, physicians use tools that are not covered by HIPAA and may have different privacy and security standards. For example, physicians use medical devices that are overseen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations regulation and guidance, yet the electronic medical information created by these devices that is entered in a physicians electronic health record (EHR) system is regulated by the Office of Civil Rights (OCR). Physicians also have patients who use medical applications (apps) that transmit protected health information and/or connect with the physicians EHR. These apps are often within the purview of the Federal Trade Commission as opposed to OCR, which oversees HIPAA. This raises questions about how physicians should navigate the protected health information that flows from a physicians practice to a patients app and back to the physicians EHR. Furthermore, if a patients app is not secure, the information could introduce security vulnerabilities to the physicians health information technology (health IT) network. It is becoming increasingly unclear to both physicians and patients how, when, and which regulations pertain to apps and an individuals information. As use of open application programming interfaces (APIs) increase, and patients more frequently use apps to access their health information, the federal government must provide consistent, thoughtful, and holistic guidance and regulatory requirements so that physicians understand how to keep their patients information secure. <br/><br/>Additionally, we urge the federal government to prioritize and support methods that enable physicians to protect and securely share pieces of information on a granular, as opposed to document, level. Physicians often need to send certain types of health information, or a section of a medical record, without sending the entire record. In fact, sometimes this is required by HIPAA (in other words, sending a minimum necessary amount of information), or by state law. Such technology existsfor example, Consent2Share, an open-source software developed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), allows patients to designate which information they wish to share and with whom. This, along with other technology, can better enable the entire medical community to share and access sensitive information. However, the AMA has heard from physicians thatwhile Consent2Share is freethe cost to integrate Consent2Share with an EHR is prohibitive because health IT vendors state that the software must be customized to the physicians EHR. The federal government should do more to support efforts to efficiently share data electronically, including subsets of a patients medical record, and to monitor costs associated with doing so.<br/><br/>Lastly, the AMA appreciates the draft Federal Data Strategys promotion of efficient use of data access, including open access to appropriate machine-readable public data, development of a culture to sharing data with external partners, and explicit communication of allowable use with periodic review of informed consent. In providing open access to appropriate data, the AMA encourages disclosure of the characteristics of the datasets, including the data sources, data collection, and data curation methods, accompanied by an assessment of potential biases resulting from the data-gathering process and any efforts made to mitigate these risks. Accounting for unintended bias in data sets is a central metric of data quality and a key to mitigating the risk of potentially furthering disparities.<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the draft principles. Laura Hoffman, available at laura.hoffman@ama-assn.org or 202-789-7414, would be pleased to respond to any questions about our comments. <br/>

I suffered many of the exact same symptoms that these victims of today are suffering. I was diagnosed with MCTD and was involved in the Global Class Action Lawsuit against Dow Corning and Mcghan. I was awarded $20,000 to take care of all my medical and legal costs. I was required to sign a legal document when accepting the judgement in my case , that I would never come back to claim anything in the future. Hum! Wonder why?  I had both implant outer shells that were mostly dissentegrated , extra capsular ruputure and leakage. Migration of silicone in my left armpit and lymphnode. After explantation I recouperated very well, lost body inflamation and weight. With the exception of the fact that I am very suseptable to catching any kind of virus or flu and it lasting way longer than average time for the normal person, or the fact that if I don't get 8 hours sleep I wake up to cold like symptoms, I have been doing fine up until 3 yrs. ago.  Over these many years I have removed small yellow rubbery pieces of silicone from my face on numerous occasions, once from my hand and once from my knee. Now at 53 many of my symptoms are coming back. Overall body muscle and joint pains, reynauds, joint swelling, numbness in hands, extreme fatigue, disfagia, frequent urination, feeling of bugs crawling on skin. Extreme back, neck and shoulder pain. Dry eyes, dry mouth and extreme dry skin. Red scaley patches on my skin. Pain in bones and skin as if the flu without having fever, extreme stiffness after rest. Am currently going through all kinds of tests to see what is going on now since I have not had any need to for so many years.  Us victims from the 90's were the industries guinea pigs! The industry should have been required to follow us for life after more than 450,000 of us were harmed.  We are all the proof that was needed for the FDA to know these devices were and are still not safe yet the almighty $$$$ prevailed as usual. There is no excuse to allow this to continue. Now , with social media we have more power to get our message out, more power to fight you all and we will not be silenced. FDA needs to ban implants period!!! If you need my files and proof I still have all the paperwork after all these years.  The only thing I was told is that BI's could have capsular contraction and to avoid this you must do massages and that they might need replacing in 10 yrs. Nothing at all about any illness that could come from getting them or I would have never agreed to get them as my whole reason to get them was to lift my breast without so many scars.

INFO - Comment: As an adult who enjoys premium cigars, I support the FDA's proposal that premium cigars be exempt from FDA regulation. I agree with much of the FDA's proposed definition of premium cigars. However, the FDA should not include a $10 minimum price requirement. In my opinion, the FDA has no role in setting prices for products it regulates. In addition, a $10 dividing line is arbitrary in defining the high-quality cigars that I enjoy. Price does not dictate whether or not a cigar is in fact premium. Premium cigars come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and prices. A $10 minimum price could result in many of the premium cigars I enjoy no longer being available, or being sold at an increased price. It would restrict my product choice while not addressing the FDA's public health goals. Therefore, I strongly believe that the FDA should remove the $10 minimum price requirement from the definition of a premium cigar. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.

INFO - Comment: Thank you for your public service.<br/><br/>I am writing to express my concerns about how the proposed rule, “Proposed Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace” (Agency Docket No: EEOC-2023-0005), could negatively impact my workplace. This rule would erroneously expand the definition of “harassment” to the detriment of free speech.<br/><br/>First, the rule considers the “intentional and repeated use of a name or pronoun inconsistent with the individual’s gender identity (misgendering)” to be harassment. This is a dangerous change in definition. Declining to use pronouns that do not align with one’s biological sex is not harassment; it is simply exercising one’s constitutionally protected right to freedom of speech. The federal government should not require employers to force their employees to use pronouns that are inconsistent with biological reality and against their conscience. Besides being a violation of conscience, it is a violation of religious freedom for religious employees who do not want to be forced to agree to an ideology that contradicts their religious worldview.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the rule considers "harassment" to include maintaining separate bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers based on biological sex (rather than "gender identity") to be a form of harassment. This could not be further from the truth. Sex-segregated spaces are designed to protect individuals, especially women and children. Forcing employers to allow anyone to use any bathroom, locker room, or shower based solely on their self-identification endangers women and girls, and in many cases, violates the conscience of employers who want to preserve sex-segregated spaces for the safety of their employees.<br/><br/>Second, the proposed rule states that employers have “a duty to protect workers against religiously motivated harassment.” Of course, I do not want to see anyone harassed in the workplace. However, this framing of the issue insinuates that one’s personal religious beliefs are potentially a source of harassment, thereby pointing to the need for extra scrutiny against religious employees. Instead of pointing fingers at religion, the EEOC should focus on protecting my First Amendment right to religious freedom. This rule undermines my First Amendment rights when it states that employers’ responsibility to protect workers from “religiously motivated” harassment is more important than their responsibility to “accommodate employees’ sincerely held religious beliefs, practices, and observances in the absence of undue hardship.”<br/><br/>Finally, the proposed rule indicates that disagreeing with a woman’s “reproductive decisions, such as decisions about contraception or abortion,” may be considered harassment. This would pose a serious threat to freedom of speech in the workplace. No woman should be harassed in the workplace, but the language of the proposed rule raises concerns that anyone who expresses disapproval of abortion as a policy matter could be accused of harassment. All employees must be allowed to respectfully express their views on controversial topics of public concern, including contraception or abortion.<br/><br/>For all of these reasons, I oppose the proposed rule.

INFO - Comment: Dear NOAA Officials,<br/><br/>Please include captive whales, specifically Lolita held at the Miami Seaquarium, in the protection given to whales in the wild. Lolita was violently taken from her Southern Resident killer whale distinct population segment family, which is now protected under the Endangered Species Act. Lolita has languished for the past 43 years and has earned her retirement. She has suffered enough, living in loneliness without the companionship of another orca for more than three decades, as well as being exposed to the harsh Florida sun and being confined to the extremely small size of the tank in which she is kept – all in violation of USDA’s Animal Welfare Act.<br/><br/>The releasability of long-term captive orcas has been studied extensively, and research suggests that Lolita’s release would be both safe and beneficial to her well-being. Lolita’s retirement plan has been refined by whale experts since its inception in 1997, and it addresses all aspects of her release. Specifically:<br/><br/>There is no significant risk to Lolita or to the wild orcas regarding retirement in her native waters. Orcas can be safely transported, and immersion of captive marine mammals in their native waters has been described as ‘therapeutic’ by experts.<br/>A thorough examination will be conducted by a team of veterinarians and pathologists prior to transport to detect any potential communicable diseases, both for Lolita’s sake and for the sake of the wild orcas.<br/>Remaining in captivity will result in continuing mental and physical stresses and health deterioration. Captive whales die at younger ages than their wild counterparts: a fact that has been well-documented.<br/>Please do the right thing by granting Lolita the protection allowed to her wild relatives. Grant her retirement from her life in captivity, and return her to her native waters.<br/>

The proposed rule will not only provide much-needed transparency in the drug pricing system, but it will ensure savings generated by those rebates directly benefit patients with high drug costs instead of middlemen. This will significantly improve access and affordability for seniors and other patients with chronic conditions, leading to better health outcomes and reduced long-term medical spending. I am pleased to see the Administration advancing out-of-pocket cost saving solutions like this one that puts seniors over middlemen {PBMs/Insurers} and I urge you to implement this proposal.

INFO - Comment: I write to express deep concern regarding the proposed 8% cut to physical therapy services that has been included in the 2020 Physician Fee Schedule and Quality Payment Program proposed rule to help pay for standard E/M visits, for which physical therapists cannot bill.<br/><br/>As a member of the physical therapy community, I am proud of the patient-preferred, non-pharmaceutical care we are able to provide for Medicare beneficiaries addressing injury, chronic pain, or restricted mobility. However, arbitrary cuts of this magnitude will impede my ability to continue providing services for seniors and individuals with disabilities. <br/><br/>This proposed cut is the latest in a history of cuts to physical therapy services over the past decade. If implemented, the proposed 2021 reduction would come after a 2011 multiple procedure payment reduction (MPPR) policy cut, which was deepened further in 2013. Margins for physical therapists are already so low that many providers, particularly in rural and underserved areas, will likely be forced to close if this additional cut is implemented in 2021.<br/><br/>Looking toward the future, I am concerned what these cuts could mean for our physical therapy workforce. We are already in the middle of a national shortage of physical therapists and physical therapy professionals- and estimates indicate that an additional 27,000 PTs will be needed to meet demand by 2025. At a time when we need to be incentivizing individuals to join the profession, I fear that the shrinking reimbursement for PT services will discourage individuals from choosing this profession in the future. <br/> <br/>Furthermore, if CMS wants to reach the stated goal of decreasing opioid use, we should be expanding access to physical therapy - not cutting it. In its Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends physical therapy as an alternative to opioids for the treatment of chronic pain. The CDC notes PT is especially effective at reducing pain and improving function in cases of low back pain, fibromyalgia, and hip and knee osteoarthritis. Providing this type of nonpharmacological therapy is only possible if we are able to keep our doors open and continue seeing Medicare patients.<br/><br/>Last, the availability of physical therapy should be encouraged among older Americans because of the critical role it plays in preventing harmful senior falls. Accounting for roughly 300,000 hip fractures, 800,000 hospitalizations, and 27,000 deaths every year, falls are the leading cause of injury-related emergency room visits for older Americans. It is estimated that medical expenditures attributable to fatal and nonfatal falls are roughly $50 billion annually, underscoring the need to support fall prevention strategies and treatments.<br/><br/>The physical therapy community is eager to work with CMS to ensure that Medicare patients in need of care are not the hurt by the unintended consequences of this proposal. I hope you will re-consider moving forward with the reimbursement cuts proposed before finalizing this rule.

INFO - Comment: Please support the adoption of two quality measures on nursing for inclusion in CMS quality reporting program in the Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems (IPPS) for Acute Care Hospitals and the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System (LTCH PPS) and Proposed Policy Changes and Fiscal Year 2018 Rates; Quality Reporting Requirements for Specific Providers. Specifically, please support: Nurse Staffing; and Staff Skill Mix, which refers to the combination or grouping of different categories of workers providing patient care.<br/><br/>Nurses are critical to patient safety in hospital settings and are the most trusted providers on the health care delivery team. Studies continue to find that inadequate registered nurse staffing is associated with increased mortality and multiple types of avoidable adverse events causing patient harm, reinforcing the need to match staffing and skill mix to patients need for nursing care. In fact, there is a direct correlation between nurse staffing, patient satisfaction, readmissions, and adverse events. <br/><br/>Yet patients and their families are unable to access information on Hospital Compare about how many nurses are staffing the unit to which they may be admitted and the staff skill mix, both of which ultimately impact outcomes. Skill mix is part of the formula for appropriate staffing. Proper use of support personnel improves nurses workflow, permitting nurses to fully apply their professional knowledge and skill.<br/><br/>I support the provisions of this proposed rule that establish public reporting of the two nurse staffing quality measures to help consumers compare hospitals based on the level of nurse staffing and staff skill mix. The American Nurses Association (ANA) first championed these nursing-sensitive quality measures in 1994 and continues to stand behind them. Both measures are fully endorsed as a priority for Hospital Compare by the National Quality Forum (NQF), a non-partisan organization that endorses valid, evidence-based quality measures. This is the gold-star seal of approval for quality measures.<br/><br/>Nurse staffing data gives consumers tools to make an informed decision when selecting from comparable hospitals. There is currently a wide variation in nurse staffing and staff skill mix in hospitals across the country. Patients need to know that there is a nurse at the other end of the call button. Transparency empowers patients and their families with information to understand the staffing levels compared to other similar hospitals, providing essential information to decisions makers. <br/><br/>Reporting these data is not a paperwork burden to hospitals, nurses or other clinicians. In fact, in hospital settings, this information is not necessarily being newly collected but rather, newly reported  the measures collect electronic data already included in hospital databases; more than 2,000 hospitals in the US have already adopted these measures. <br/><br/>Hospitals which invest in appropriate nurse staffing and skill mix to meet the needs of their patients will receive higher ratings. Hospital Compare generally ranks hospitals using the data from these measures to award up to 5 stars. A hospital with strong nurse staffing and skill mix level will receive a higher star rating  and will stand out strongly in an apples-to-apples comparison with hospitals who are not investing in appropriate nurse staffing.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and attention.

INFO - Comment: The North Atlantic right whale is critically endangered and needs immediate help to recover. It is NOAA Fisheries legal responsibility under the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to protect right whales from injury and death in U.S. waters. <br/><br/>Without a doubt, the greatest threat to right whales in U.S. waters is entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Since fisheries regulations were published in September 2021, two whales have died after becoming entangled in gear. NOAA Fisheries is legally required to immediately reduce by 90% or more the risk that lobster and crab gear poses to these critically endangered animals. Targeted vertical-line closures based on sightings, acoustic detections, and prey data are the only way to achieve this risk reduction requirement under the MMPA mandate. <br/><br/>Specifically, as part of conservation measures required to achieve the necessary level of risk reduction, NOAA Fisheries should expand the length of time and the area of current vertical-line closures. The closure south of Nantucket and Marthas Vineyard in Massachusetts should be year-round and expanded, the Gulf of Maine closure should expand to include the month of February and include the western portion of Statistical Fishing Area 515 (SFA 515), the Great South Channel closure should expand to include SFA 521, and the Massachusetts Restricted Area closure should expand from December through mid-May and include Jeffreys Ledge and SFA 514. NOAA Fisheries should also implement additional closures based on known right whale migration corridors. This should include new vertical-line closures in the Gulf of Maine, including in Down East Maine from June through August, a mid-Atlantic closure (New York/Connecticut line to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina) from December through May, and a south Atlantic closure (Cape Hatteras to northern Florida) from December through March. <br/><br/>The North Atlantic right whale population can recover if NOAA Fisheries implements effective measures to protect right whales from the painful and inhumane entanglements that kill them. The regulations must immediately meet the level of risk reduction required by the law, which requires closures to commercial fishing in areas where right whales concentrate.

INFO - Comment: The Red Wolf Recovery Plan called for the reintroduction of wolves into at least three areas within the wolf's historic range. Each population should be allowed to grow numerically large enough for the natural evolutionary processes to work within the species and remove threats of extinction. This could be accomplished by achieving three wild populations totaling approximately 220 wolves.<br/><br/>The wild population in eastern North Carolina has been the most successful of all wild reintroductions of red wolves, reaching 130 wolves in 2005. This site--as well as others--allows for the eventual establishment of a healthy metapopulation, featuring interactions between populations to achieve the necessary exchange of genetic material critical to species restoration and eventual delisting. Increased genetic diversity from additional reintroductions will further act to mitigate inbreeding depression associated with small isolated populations. Expansion of the current wild program is also of critical importance as a genetic buffer against disease. <br/><br/>Tools for population management must include controlling coyote hybridization and gunshot mortality, as well as pup fostering, which is a significant population management tool for ensuring red wolf recovery. The threat of hybridization is minimized by promoting an environment that bolsters red wolf populations and supports encounters between red wolves. Establishing sterile placeholder coyote individuals in the landscape to reduce hybridization can work, and needs to be part of any revised recovery strategy. Disease monitoring and prevention plans are also needed. Perhaps most importantly, the red wolf program needs a 10(j) rule that prioritizes red wolf conservation and recovery instead of allowing landowners to kill wolves, especially when nonlethal methods of avoiding conflict are widely available, and the population is so vulnerable. <br/><br/>According to Sparkman, Hinton, Bohling, Waits, and other experts on coyote/red wolf hybridization, in larger populations, red wolves will likely have less incidence of hybridization with other species of canids, as red wolves will have a larger pool of available mates. In addition, the Red Wolf Adaptive Management Plan--including targeted control of coyotes and hybrids and release of sterilized coyotes to hold territories until red wolves move into the territory or are reintroduced--was extremely effective at limiting introgression of coyote genes into the red wolf population. In fact, the US Fish and Wildlife Service itself concluded in its last five-year review of the red wolf: "We have effectively reduced interbreeding and coyote gene introgression using the adaptive plan and associated non-invasive techniques, all with assistance from scientists on the Red Wolf Recovery Implementation Team."<br/><br/>A revised 10(j) rule must truly provide for the conservation of red wolves. The current implementation of the rule has allowed for the dramatic decline in the species in recent years, showing that greater protections are needed. Gunshot mortality and removals from private lands have become leading threats to the species; the lenient standards currently in place, intended to bolster landowner support for the program, must be balanced against the needs of the species.

Our public lands, as well as other areas governed by these rules, provide necessary habitat for birds and excellent opportunities for recreation, among other values. It's irresponsible to reduce the ability to comment on or understand the effects of projects that impact these lands and wildlife.  <br/><br/>I have serious concerns about removing the requirement to consider all types of impacts (including indirect and cumulative impacts), which would undermine the need for agencies to consider the impacts to our climate from projects. With 3 billion birds lost from North America in the last 50 years and nearly two-thirds at risk from climate change, this is no time to ignore the likely effects of decisions. I am also concerned about expanding the use of categorical exclusions, limiting the requirement to consider alternatives to proposed actions, and allowing companies to prepare their own analyses to justify their projects. We need meaningful and unbiased review of proposed actions that could harm birds, other wildlife and all the natural resources we depend on.<br/><br/>NEPA is a bedrock environmental law that informs science-based, transparent, and accountable decision making, but this proposed rule would weaken those vital standards.

As a practicing academic anesthesiologist, I <br/>am vitally concerned about the portion of the proposed rule relating to Section 139: <br/>Improvements for Medicare Anesthesia Teaching Programs.<br/><br/>In 2008, Congress passed, as part of MIPPA, the Medicare Anesthesiology <br/>Teaching Funding Restoration Act to restore full Medicare payment to academic <br/>anesthesiology programs.  Prior to this change, academic anesthesiologists have <br/>been penalized for supervising two residents simultaneouly.  <br/><br/>I am a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist.  A cardiac surgeon can be supervising two <br/>residents at the same time.  I may be taking care of the same two patients as the <br/>cardiac surgeon with two anesthesiology residents/fellows. I am paid one half for <br/>each procedure; the surgeon is paid fully for both procedures.  There is an inherent <br/>flaw in such a system.  <br/><br/>Transfer of care to another anesthesiologist should, in no way, determine whether <br/>the full payment for anesthesia care is made.  Transfering care to another <br/>anesthesiologist is a necessary part of running an effecient and quality service.  In <br/>academic medicine, cases tend to be longer necessitating transfering care to <br/>another anesthesiology attending when the case load has diminished and the non-<br/>call person is expected to be back to work early the next day.<br/><br/>Safe anesthesia care to all patients is a vital concern for me.  In fact, <br/>anesthesiology is sited by other specialties and the Institute of Medicine as having <br/>a stellar safety record.  That achievement has occured because anesthesiologists <br/>are incredibly safety conscious.  Let us do the things we know how to do.  If <br/>transfer of care is done properly, the anesthesiologist assuming care will be fully <br/>apprised of the patient's condition and situation and can continue to deliver safe <br/>care.<br/><br/>Please take these comments into consideration and keep the teaching rule as <br/>changed in 2008 to bring the anesthesiologists into parity with the other academic <br/>specialists.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Peggy G.

INFO - Comment: Dear U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, <br/><br/>Please keep Ute ladies’ tresses protected under the Endangered Species Act. <br/><br/>The agency's proposed delisting of Spiranthes diluvialis is arbitrary, premature, and unsupported by the best available science. One of the rarest and most beautiful orchid species in the western United States, Ute ladies’ tresses face myriad threats that are exacerbated by climate change. And with 72% of the species’ occurrences currently threatened or expected to be in the near future, it’s not recovered and shouldn’t be stripped of safeguards. <br/><br/>Habitat for the orchids is deteriorating at some sites, and historic populations in Utah and Colorado have been extirpated. Population monitoring in these states has led to projections of long-term declines — if not extirpations — in both riparian corridors and wet meadows and under current land-use practices without conservation intervention. In Idaho long-term monitoring has shown habitat deterioration leading to local extirpation of Ute ladies’ tresses subpopulations. <br/><br/>The species has a narrow range of environmental tolerances and complex life-history characteristics. Its seeds are likely short-lived and rely on a unique symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal soil fungi to survive. The plants themselves depend on the frequent disturbance and early seral habitat conditions that result from perennial stream flooding. <br/><br/>Meanwhile hydrology change, recreation impacts, cattle and horse grazing, reduction in number and diversity of insect pollinators, drought, habitat loss, and more all seriously threaten the species — and climate change compounds all these threats. In 2015 the Bureau of Land Management ranked riparian habitat vulnerability to climate change as high in eastern Colorado and very high in western Colorado.  <br/><br/>While I celebrate true Endangered Species Act success stories, the Fish and Wildlife Service’s delisting proposal for Ute ladies’ tresses isn’t a cause for celebration. Threats are mounting — not diminishing — for these unique, delicate orchids. To survive they need protection now more than ever. <br/><br/>Please abandon the terrible plan to delist the Ute ladies’ tresses.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Linda Hayes<br/>VA 23452

INFO - Comment: Pregnancy is not a disease, and drugs and surgeries to prevent it are not basic health care that the government should require all Americans to purchase.  Please remove sterilization and prescription contraceptives from the list of "preventive services" the federal government is mandating in private health plans.  It is especially important to exclude any drug that may cause an early abortion, and to fully respect religious freedom as other federal laws do.  The narrow religious exemption in HHS's new rule protects almost no one. I urge you to allow all organizations and individuals to offer, sponsor and obtain health coverage that does not violate their moral and religious convictions.

INFO - Comment: I have been a Heavy Equipment Operator with the IUOE for 25 years. Industry-registered apprenticeship programs are not right for the construction industry. We need highly trained workers to build America's infrastructure so we build it safe, on time and on budget. I support the Department of Labor's decision to exclude construction from industry-recognized apprenticeship programs so that future generations of apprentices continue to receive excellent skills training.<br/><br/>If construction were included in the proposed industry-registered apprenticeship programs, it would allow greedy unscrupulous contractors to lower our standards, cut corners, and boost profits on the backs of their workers. Allowing training programs that do not meet the standards required of registered programs would undercut my training and effort.  My local union, and other IUOE local unions across the country, invest a tremendous amount of money every year training members at state-of-the-art facilities. Our programs produce the most highly skilled Operating Engineers in the construction industry. Don't change something that works.<br/><br/>My path to the middle-class will disappear if construction is ever included in the industry-registered apprenticeship program. By permanently excluding construction, apprentices will continue to receive the best training and the registered programs will continue to provide the industry with the highest skilled workforce in the world. <br/><br/>John  Graeler

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Betsy DeVos,<br/><br/>Docket ID ED-2018-OPE-0027<br/>RIN: 1840-AD26<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the recent changes to the borrower defense to repayment rule. Unfortunately, the revised rule caters to the interests of schools that continually engage in deceptive behavior and guts critical protections for borrowers that have been taken advantage of by their institutions.    <br/><br/>First, the rule requires students prove their institution intentionally defrauded them, meaning students will have to provide evidence of their institutions intent to mislead them. This requirement places a disproportionate burden on the backs of students that have already suffered financial harm, the burden should instead fall on the Department to investigate and collect evidence for borrower defense claims.  <br/><br/>Second, the Department should not limit claims to students who have already defaulted on their loans or are already in some form of debt collection. By the time a borrower enters default their ability to buy a home, develop good credit, or navigate financial hardship is significantly limited. This requirement demonstrates yet again the administrations willingness to protect the needs of potentially fraudulent institutions at the expense of students financial security. <br/><br/>Third, the new rule allows institutions to utilize a practice known as forced arbitration. Institutions will once again be allowed to compel students to sign away their legal rights, and in doing so allow the institution to continue to engage in deceitful behavior without the threat of substantive legal action to be taken against them. <br/> <br/>Finally, the proposed rule would eliminate the ability of borrowers deceived by their institution to submit a group claim or get automatic relief if their school closed or shut down. In effect, in the absence of quality information or direction, this requirement severely limits the ability of borrowers to find a pathway to relief.<br/><br/>The proposed rule fails to serve the students whom the department is meant to protect. Students that have been deceived, defrauded, or taken advantage of will be met with a long and burdensome process that will fail to provide them with the justice they are due. The rule as currently proposed, fails to adequately hold institutions accountable to their actions. Under this rule, students and taxpayers will continue to pay the price for institutions deceptive and fraudulent behavior.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Joseph Quirk<br/>New York, NY 10009

INFO - Comment: I am writing to urge you to stop the changes to longstanding regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act you recently proposed. These changes would drastically weaken the interagency consultation provision of the Endangered Species Act -- widely considered the most important and effective provision of the Act -- and also undercut the Endangered Species Act's proper role in addressing the impacts of climate change on our nation's most imperiled wildlife. <br/><br/>For 35 years the Endangered Species Act has protected imperiled species from the effects of potentially harmful federal projects. The strength of the Endangered Species Act has been the checks and balances created by interagency consultation between federal agencies that build roads, issue logging permits, and lease oil and gas rights among other projects, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and National Marine Fisheries Services, whose primary responsibility is the conservation of endangered species. <br/><br/>Interagency consultation ensures that federal projects that may impact America's most imperiled wildlife are independently reviewed by federal wildlife experts and project modifications are made where necessary. In the overwhelming majority of consultations federal projects move forward with little or no significant changes.<br/><br/>The regulations you recently proposed would eliminate interagency consultation on thousands of federal projects that pose a risk to endangered and threatened species each year. The changes will almost certainly result in detrimental impacts on endangered and imperiled species and a higher propensity to overlook opportunities to avoid such impacts.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the fact that these are the most significant changes to regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act in more than 20 years, you have provided the public just 30 days in which to submit comments, not the traditional 90, and prevented anyone from sending their comments by email. <br/><br/>I request you set an additional 60 days to allow the public an opportunity to meaningfully comment on these proposed regulations.<br/><br/>I also urge you to not to finalize these regulatory changes. <br/><br/>Thank you.

INFO - Comment: Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Revised Designation of Critical Habitat for Canada lynxes in the Western United States. I appreciate the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's efforts to dedicate habitat for members of this iconic species and your consideration of the climate crisis and human infrastructure impacts on Canada lynx survival. While your plan is a positive step, I believe it could be improved with the following recommendations:<br/><br/>Carefully Consider Exclusions: The Service should evaluate whether the existing Habitat Conservation Plans in Unit 3 (Montana DNRC Multi-Species Habitat Conservation Plan) and Unit 4 (Washington DNR Lynx Habitat Management Plan) offer stronger protections for lynx habitat. Exclusions should only be permitted if these plans demonstrate stronger conservation measures. Otherwise, the Service should prioritize retaining areas under the Critical Habitat designation to ensure lynxes receive the highest level of protection.<br/><br/>Incorporate Tier 3 Areas for Connectivity: Connectivity is essential for the survival and dispersal of lynxes, and Tier 3 areas, while smaller, can facilitate this connectivity across the landscape. These areas should be included, especially in Units 6 and 7, where habitat is fragmented and isolated from the core lynx range. Expanding connectivity could help reestablish historical dispersal patterns, such as those observed with lynxes occasionally reaching the Southern Rockies from Canada during population booms.<br/><br/>Expand Unit 5 Beyond the 2014 Designation: The proposed reductions in Unit 5’s Critical Habitat are deeply concerning and may fail to meet the Service’s obligation to designate adequate habitat for species recovery. Instead of reductions, Unit 5 should be expanded to at least match — if not exceed — the 2014 designation. Given the increasing threats posed by the climate crisis, a larger protected habitat is critical for the long-term survival of lynxes as individuals and as a species.<br/><br/>Support Snowshoe Hare Conservation: Since lynx survival is closely tied to the availability of snowshoe hares, the Service should incorporate measures to conserve hare populations in areas where they are low. Ensuring abundant prey availability is fundamental to successful lynx recovery.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering these suggestions to strengthen the Critical Habitat Designation for the Canada lynx. These enhancements will ensure that the plan provides the strongest protections possible for this species in the face of the climate crisis and other threats.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Luciana Redolfi

INFO - Comment: Alexander Acosta,<br/><br/>Back in 1975, President Gerald Fords Labor Department set the salary level for overtime exemption at the equivalent of about $58,000 in todays dollarshigh enough to cover more than 50 percent of full-time salaried workers. The Obama-era rule set it at $47,476high enough to cover about 34 percent of full-time salaried employees but lower than the level that it was in the 1970s. Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people. The whole point of having national standards is to ensure decent basic standards for all workers. The updated overtime standard is already linked to the lowest-wage Census region. Workers rights and wages should not be undercut even further by weakening the salary threshold.<br/><br/>Beate Lohser<br/>drlohser@yahoo.com<br/>beate<br/>Oakland, California 94619

INFO - Comment: I commend the FDA for listening to the homeopathy community and posting a revised Draft Guidance rather than finalizing the previous one. However, I believe the FDA has not understood the homeopathy community completely. Though the agency purports to take a risk-based approach to policing homeopathic medicines, the new Draft Guidance would threaten the future of all homeopathy while increasing risk to consumers.<br/><br/>THE DRAFT GUIDANCE THREATENS ALL OF HOMEOPATHY<br/><br/>The Draft Guidance, if adopted, will allow the FDA to withdraw nontoxic, inherently safe generic name homeopathic medicines from the marketplace, not just particular brands or lots that have been improperly manufactured and/or labeled.<br/><br/>An initial review of public FDA records by Americans for Homeopathy Choice shows that safety concerns about properly manufactured and labeled homeopathic medicines appear nowhere. All of the FDA's concerns relate to improperly manufactured and/or labeled products which do not meet homeopathic standards.<br/><br/>If the FDA does not intend to withdraw properly manufactured and labeled generic name homeopathic medicines, why does it seek the authority to do so? It seems clear that the FDA intends to use this authority and has even mentioned specific medicines such as Belladonna, Nux vomica and Lachesis muta in its public statements regarding enforcement.<br/><br/>The FDA claims that its authority to withdraw generic name homeopathic medicines completely from the market results from the designation of homeopathic medicines as "new drugs." Nowhere in federal law are homeopathic medicines designated as "new drugs."<br/><br/>First, homeopathic medicines are not new in any sense of the word. Many of them pre-date the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 and most pre-date the 1962 amendments. Second, those amendments are designed to deal with inherently dangerous substances in order to determine whether the benefits of a particular substance used as a drug outweigh the risks.<br/><br/>Since properly manufactured and labeled homeopathic medicines are nontoxic and inherently safe when used as directed, these amendments do not apply to homeopathic medicines. There is no risk to weigh against the benefit of a properly manufactured and labeled homeopathic medicine used as directed. We know this from the rigorous reviews including human trials which homeopathic medicines undergo for safety and efficacy before inclusion in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States.<br/><br/>In short, the FDA cannot make new law through a guidance document. Only Congress can change the status of homeopathic drugs.<br/><br/>THE DRAFT GUIDANCE INCREASES RISK<br/><br/>Increased risk to consumers is a direct result of the threat posed by the Draft Guidance to all of homeopathy. By withdrawing properly manufactured and labeled generic name homeopathic medicines, the FDA will increase risks both to individual consumers and to public health in the following manner:<br/><br/>1. Many consumers will be denied access to the particular nontoxic, inherently safe homeopathic medicine which has helped them. These persons will increasingly be forced to seek higher-risk alternatives including OTC remedies that haven't been tested for safety and efficacy and pharmaceuticals, many of which are known to create dangerous and even fatal side-effects.<br/><br/>2. Homeopathic medicines may no longer be available to help address infections without creating antibiotic resistance or to treat pain without causing opioid dependence and death. Learn more at HomeopathyChoice.org/Research.<br/><br/>3. The FDA's risk-based approach makes no sense when applied to properly manufactured and labeled homeopathic medicines used as directed. These medicines are by definition nontoxic and inherently safe. They are not pharmacologically active and work by a different principle. To focus resources on policing them would divert resources from much riskier categories such as even properly manufactured and labeled pharmaceuticals which the agency recognizes have toxicity and interaction risks because of their much higher concentrations of active ingredients.<br/><br/>A proper focus for the risked-based approach would be products IMPROPERLY labeled as homeopathic as these may not be nontoxic or inherently safe.<br/><br/>I therefore request that the FDA revise this Draft Guidance to reflect 1) that generic name homeopathic medicines are nontoxic and inherently safe when properly manufactured and labeled and used as directed, 2) that homeopathic medicines are not "new drugs" and 3) that the agency's risk-based approach will be applied only to products IMPROPERLY labeled as homeopathic.

INFO - Comment: I am writing as a responsible tobacco retailer in Oklahoma to oppose the proposed ban on licensed retailers selling flavored cigars to adults 21 and older.  I am proud of the work we do every day to make sure tobacco products are sold only to adults 21 and older.  Please do not move forward with this unfair proposal that could harm tobacco retailers across the United States by shifting many of these products to illegal sellers that don't care who they sell to or how they do it.<br/><br/>If implemented, this proposal could hurt retailers and wholesalers in the U.S. and directly impact my bottom line.  This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue.  An estimated 37% to 47% of popular price large cigars are flavored, generating $4 to 5 billion in nationwide annual retail sales. Additionally, adult customers who purchase flavored cigars also purchase gas, food, and other items that my store depends on.<br/><br/>It makes no sense to end the sale of these products through licensed retail stores like mine.  Bans could shift sales to illegal markets where many consumers can still get them, but without any regulatory protection or underage prevention. Flavor bans create illegal markets that could endanger the public with bootleg products, cause tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access, crime, arrests, and community conflict.<br/><br/>Underage use of cigars is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21---not with bans that create illegal markets.  Responsible, licensed retailers like me have worked hard to comply with age-verification requirements, and these efforts are a big reason why underage rates have fallen so low.<br/><br/>I respectfully urge you to reconsider a ban on flavored cigars, and instead focus on more positive solutions that respect the role of responsible, legal businesses like mine.  Instead of banning products for adults, the government should be giving adult smokers more information and choices for lower risk tobacco products -- as well as continuing to focus on underage prevention and education.<br/>

INFO - Comment: Dear Food & Drug Administration,<br/><br/>I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don't believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA's stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.<br/><br/>Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.<br/><br/>I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information. Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.<br/><br/>The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means. This goes against common sense and can put Americans' lives at risk. People deserve full access to their prescription drug information at all times, no matter their age, income, or geographic location.<br/><br/>I urge you to revise your proposed rule for patient medication information in two ways:<br/><br/>1. Require a standardized printed format that has been scientifically researched and proven to improve patient understanding.<br/><br/>2. Require the drug manufacturer to supply the printed information and have it accompany the drug product and not printed in a retail pharmacy.<br/><br/>Doing so will help save lives and improve medication outcomes.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr Taoufik M Zemmel<br/>IL

INFO - Comment: As  patent & a grandparent I am appalled that a covid vaxxine is being proposed for 6 month old babies through to 5 year old children. <br/>For the sake of furthering ongoing studies by pharmaceutical companies as to adverse affects on children in this age bracket is most abhorrent & appalling. <br/>It appears that the scientific & medical advances that we have made in previous decades & centuries have started not only to decelerate but progressed to reversal of the stability & life saving practices reached so far. <br/>If this goes ahead, i.e. covid vaxxination of babies & little childrent, it is not only the immediate adverse reactions that are a concern but also the damage (that is as yet unproven & undetetmined) will cause to their reproductive capability.<br/>Please do not allow such experimentation on the innocent & precious children (as they can not think for themselves & they do not have the capacity to choose what is right & safe or unsafe for them).<br/>We need to shield, protect & nurture the little children as opposed to doing any harm or endangering them in any way whatsoever, especially where there are huge questions that have not been sufficiently answered.

INFO - Comment: Dear Bureau of Land Management,<br/><br/>I am opposed to oil and gas development in the Western Arctic.  Such development would be incompatible with meeting urgently needed commitments to address the climate crisis.  To demonstrate climate leadership and meet our commitments, the nation needs to move rapidly away from burning fossil fuels. There is no room for expansion, particularly in the Arctic, where oil would not come to market for years. The huge infrastructure build-out required would lock us into reliance on fossil fuels, while bringing further stress to a region feeling climate effects even more acutely than lower latitudes.  I urge the administration to take measures to bring its management of the Western Arctic in line with its commitment to address the climate crisis.   <br/><br/>The proposed regulations are a step in the right direction but do not go far enough.  They offer important incremental protections for some of the Western Arctic’s most ecologically and culturally important areas, such as Teshekpuk Lake, an internationally vital wetland critical for birds from around the globe and for caribou herds that are integral to Alaska Native communities in the region.  However, they do not do enough to address the most imminent threat to the region and the planet—the over two million acres of existing oil leases in the Western Arctic that this administration inherited.  Development on these existing leases—like Willow—threatens the sensitive habitat of the Western Arctic and the nation’s ability to meet its climate goals.   <br/><br/>The current environmental analysis of the Western Arctic, written in the previous administration, fails to study the impact oil development in the region would have on the climate and the nation’s ability to rapidly reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to meet climate goals.  We urge the administration to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the climate impacts of Western Arctic oil development, and to bring its management of the region in line with climate policy by expanding its proposed regulations to require limits on drilling on the millions of acres already leased to oil companies to protect the climate and the fragile resources of the region already under severe strain from climate change.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Sandra Denninger<br/>9 Mizzen Ln  Buzzards Bay, MA 02532-3313

INFO - Comment: I strongly urge the Commerce Department to remove the citizenship question from the 2020 Census form. Including an untested, controversial question will undermine the quality and accuracy of the census in every community. The Census Bureau's own Chief Scientist warned of lower response, higher costs, and a less accurate census if the citizenship question is included. Including a citizenship question puts the census at grave risk of a significant undercount, especially among hard-to-reach population groups that already are fearful of answering government surveys, according to the bureau's own research. The public should not be asked to answer, or pay for, a census that does not meet scientifically sound standards, in order to achieve partisan, political goals. The addition of this question is a blatant attempt to undermine the 2020 Census - this decision is bad for the census, bad for our communities, and bad for America.

INFO - Comment: ODA-CAFO Program<br/>Attn: Simon-J-S Ranch Comments 635 Capitol St. NE<br/>Salem, OR 97301<br/><br/>I am writing to thank the Fish and Wildlife Service for your efforts to protect the Monarch butterfly and to urge you to finalize your proposal to grant Monarchs threatened status under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). As your analysis clearly shows, there is a foreseeable risk that both the western and eastern Monarch populations will become extinct. ESA protections are urgently needed to help this amazing butterfly recover and prosper.<br/><br/>FWS has recognized that pesticides are a major factor in the Monarch’s quarter-century decline. Herbicides like glyphosate decimate the Monarch’s primary host plant, common milkweed, in agricultural lands throughout much of its Midwestern breeding range. Drift-prone herbicides like dicamba kill flowering plants adult Monarch require for nectar. Neonicotinoid seed treatments of corn, soybeans and other crops can poison Monarchs during planting operations or through contamination of the nectar of field-edge plants. I urge the Service to abstain from exempting agricultural use of pesticides in the final listing rule.<br/><br/>I applaud your proposed designation of critical habitat for the western migratory population in California. Listed species with critical habitat are far more likely to recover than those without it. I urge the Service to also establish critical habitat for the more numerous eastern population, whose range extends across the country east of the Rocky Mountains. Last year’s population reached the second-lowest level ever recorded, capping a quarter-century decline of over 80%. Please provide protected habitat to give eastern Monarchs a chance to recover.<br/><br/> Thanks for your consideration, and your efforts to save this iconic butterfly.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Shonna Davis<br/>Houlton, ME
