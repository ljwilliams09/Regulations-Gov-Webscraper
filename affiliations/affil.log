INFO - Comment: Dear Director Angelle,<br/><br/>I am writing to express strong opposition to the proposed revisions to the Well Control Rule. This rule was one of the only safety regulations implemented in the aftermath of the most devastating oil spill disaster in our nation?s history. Dismantling safety measures like the Well Control Rule while the administration simultaneously seeks a radical expansion of offshore drilling in nearly all federal waters is simply unacceptable. <br/><br/>In 2010, BP?s Deepwater Horizon rig exploded following an exploratory well blowout, which killed 11 crew members and gushed over 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The oil spill continued for 87 days as engineers tried and failed to seal the blowout. Six years later, the Well Control Rule was established to help prevent another BP-like disaster. There are far too few safety standards in place for dirty and dangerous offshore drilling and actively weakening existing safeguards is unimaginable. Weakening this rule would prioritize the profits of oil and gas companies over the safety of our environment and coastal communities. We cannot afford another offshore drilling tragedy.<br/><br/>I strongly oppose this reckless rollback of safety standards for offshore drilling. The administration is putting our marine life and healthy oceans at unnecessary risk by revising a measure that did not go far enough to begin with. I urge you to reject this proposal that would make offshore drilling even more dangerous ? we need much more safety, not less.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Layken Bovaird

INFO - Comment: The National Coalition for Literacy (NCL) is pleased to submit comments pursuant to the notice of the Secretary's Proposed Supplemental Priorities and Definitions for Discretionary Grant Programs published by the U.S. Department of Education in the Federal Register, Vol. 82, No. 196, pages 47484-47493.<br/><br/>The NCL is a national coalition of the leading national and regional organizations dedicated to advancing adult education, family literacy, and English language acquisition in the United States. A number of our member organizations and affiliates will be providing specific comments on the individual proposed priorities. The comments here are general ones that address the overall goals and nature of the proposed priorities as a group.<br/><br/> The NCL welcomes the emphasis on empowering parents and ensuring equal access to high quality education that is embodied in the proposed priorities. Achievement of these goals, as well as the goal of promoting decision-making and control at the State and local levels, will depend on the active participation of community members who themselves have the educational backgrounds and skills necessary for informed decision-making. Yet the recent PIAAC survey of U.S. adults' skill levels has shown that 16 percent of adults have literacy skills below the middle school level; 30 percent have similarly weak numeracy skills; and more than 30 percent have limited ability to solve problems using technology (OECD, 2013). In order for these adults to be involved in meaningful ways in the types of local decision-making that the proposed priorities envision, education opportunities that address adults' skill development needs must be included as core elements of all ED discretionary grant programs.<br/><br/>In addition, research has repeatedly shown that the single strongest predictor of children's academic persistence and attainment is the education level of the mother or primary caregiver (Sticht, 2014). The PIAAC report notes that "the performance of the initial schooling system is closely linked to adult skills" (OECD, 2013, p. 11). Rather than being an adjunct to elementary and secondary education, then, adult education is fundamental to the success of the entire education enterprise. It has the potential to break the cycle of under-education by enabling parents and primary caregivers to increase their own levels of educational attainment, and thereby to create positive, supportive educational environments for their children.<br/><br/>While educational opportunity for underserved adults is referenced directly in Proposed Priority 1, we suggest that adult basic education (ABE) and adult secondary education (ASE) be included more substantively in the proposed priorities in two ways:<br/><br/>1. Called out as an essential component of each of the proposed priorities. For example, ABE/ASE is a significant part of the overall system of educational services delivery, particularly for at-risk youth and underserved adults (Proposed Priority 2); ABE and ASE are critical to the success of career pathways  programs, and many of these programs have developed effective models for collaboration with employers (Proposed Priority 3); civics education is a central component of ABE and ASE (Proposed Priority 4); adult education enables all family members to promote children's development of literacy skills (Proposed Priority 7); persistence in adult education is directly correlated with increased economic opportunity (Morgan, Waite, & Diecuch, 2017) (Proposed Priority 9).<br/><br/>2. Included as a specific proposed priority for adults, like the proposed priorities for veterans and service members (Proposed Priority 11) and children with unique needs (Proposed Priority 5). This priority would identify the fundamental role that adult education plays in supporting the overall education system by ensuring equal opportunity, increasing career options, stabilizing families, and strengthening civil society.<br/><br/>The NCL and its member organizations envision a world in which all adults are able to fulfill their potential and meet their goals through accessing high quality adult education and literacy services provided by an integrated and well-developed system. We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed priorities and hope that this vision can be included in them.<br/><br/>On behalf of the National Coalition for Literacy,<br/><br/>Deborah Kennedy<br/>President<br/>www.national-coalition-literacy.org<br/><br/>References<br/><br/>Morgan, K., Waite, P., & Diecuch, M.

INFO - Comment: The intention of the proposed rule is just, and we applaud the CFPB's effort to regulate predatory payday lenders.<br/> <br/>The CFPB should ensure that every loan given to a borrower includes an assessment of ability to repay. No loan should be given if it cannot be repaid; to ignore ability to repay will draw borrowers into a debt trap.  <br/> <br/>There is still work to do: the proposed rule contains a loophole that provides an exception from the ability to repay standard: it still allows lenders to give up to six 300% interest loans to the same borrower in one year. This is an unacceptable number of high-interest loans; this loophole should be closed.

INFO - Comment: As a small-business operator in Pennsylvania, I'm very disappointed to learn that the FDA is considering a ban on licensed retailers selling menthol cigarettes to adults 21 and older. Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning menthol cigarettes could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since menthol cigarettes alone make up 36% of all cigarette sales in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of menthol could undermine my ability to operate by significantly impacting my revenue. Plain and simple: it's misguided and could force small businesses to close.<br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, menthol cigarettes could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime under the laws of all 50 states.  Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of menthol cigarettes is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.<br/>

The Trump Administration’s attempt to shrink the poverty line by changing how it is adjusted for inflation is cruel and irresponsible. Changing the poverty line would mean millions of people could be denied help with essential medical treatment, prescription drugs, food, and home heating or cooling assistance, or see reductions in that help. Low-income people see their costs go up more than most people, so shrinking the poverty line will simply define them as nonpoor and deny them the help they badly need. The Trump Administration should make a good-faith effort to find accurate measures of poverty and to understand the impact of the changes they propose on children, working people, retirees, women, people with disabilities, and communities of color instead of trying to redefine poverty out of existence. <br/><br/>Barbara Chidester <br/>bscats@sbcglobal.net <br/>5138 <br/>Chicago, Illinois 60630<br/><br/> <br/>

INFO - Comment: I am writing to express my concerns regarding the Draft Environmental Assessment to reduce bird damage in the state of Indiana and advocate for Alternative 2 in your current proposal for addressing bird damage, or an alternative that requires all non-lethal strategies for damage mitigation to first be exhausted before any lethal action is taken.  <br/><br/>As Indiana Wildlife Services states in the Environmental Assessment, educational outreach efforts already include promoting coexistence between humans and wild animals and human behavior modification. This should be emphasized and prioritized in the plan that Wildlife Services chooses to move forward with. The agency could also help to fund and develop new infrastructure to protect against bird damage. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the agency should either proceed with Alternative 2 or create an alternative that requires all non-lethal methods to be used to their fullest extent before lethal action is taken. Wildlife Services should also commit to exploring long-term, non-lethal solutions that promote harmony between humans and wild animals.<br/><br/>Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I trust that you will take into account the importance of preserving diverse bird populations through responsible and compassionate wildlife management.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mrs. Damaris Spisz<br/>Chandler, AZ

INFO - Comment: Dear Food & Drug Administration,<br/><br/>I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don't believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA's stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.<br/><br/>Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.<br/><br/>I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information. Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.<br/><br/>The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means. This goes against common sense and can put Americans' lives at risk. People deserve full access to their prescription drug information at all times, no matter their age, income, or geographic location.<br/><br/>I urge you to revise your proposed rule for patient medication information in two ways:<br/><br/>1. Require a standardized printed format that has been scientifically researched and proven to improve patient understanding.<br/><br/>2. Require the drug manufacturer to supply the printed information and have it accompany the drug product and not printed in a retail pharmacy.<br/><br/>Doing so will help save lives and improve medication outcomes.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms Jan Hall<br/>OH

The cost to buy a new gas car will increase, and for many Americans, buying a car is already unaffordable.<br/> <br/>And the costs aren’t just financial. According to the DOT’s own analysis, there are billions in non-economic costs to Americans: Consumers will get fewer choices, quality will decline, and safety will decrease as corners are cut to meet ridiculous fuel standards.<br/> <br/>The middle class is getting crunched and we need a government that is trying to make life easier, not harder. This administration should be fighting to lower gas prices, not increase the price of our cars.<br/> <br/>This regulation doesn’t help Americans–it helps Communist China. While we cut gas car production and buy Chinese lithium for electric cars, China builds 100 new coal plants each year. The American people are paying the price for Biden’s misguided climate agenda, and our overseas adversaries are reaping the reward.<br/><br/>This regulation hurts the American people and it makes our nation weak.

I feel if all providers learn these two concepts they will be able to have the time to provide a high level of quality care to their patients, maintain a level of income they want, yet save the entire medical system money.  I have seen rise and fall of HMOs, pay for performance, PQRS, and Meaningful Use.  All of these have failed to improve healthcare in any way.   My office has had an EHR for the last 11 years, and my patient population is not any better now than before.  However, in the 8 years prior to EHR implementation, and purely due to my coding and documentation skills, I was able to improve my patients care and all quality metrics. <br/>MIPS and APMs are going to drive more providers out of medicine, and many patients will be discharged from practices if they are causing the provider's metrics to be poor.  There will be no improvement in patient health.  Any monetary savings will come mainly from providers receiving less reimbursement in the name of failing to meet arbitrary metrics that have yet to show any benefit in our country's healthcare. <br/>I think we need to develop a mandatory educational program done in person by practicing, certified coding physicians to educate providers and thier office staff.  This will translate in better care and cost savings.<br/>

INFO - Comment: Dear Fish and Wildlife Service,<br/><br/>Thank you for undoing some of the Trump administration’s damage to critical Endangered Species Act regulations. I am heartened by many aspects of your proposed restoration. <br/><br/>However, there are multiple aspects of your proposed rules that are insufficient for the challenges that endangered wildlife are facing.  <br/><br/>First, you must go back to the drawing board and fully restore section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, which governs interagency consultation. For 50 years it's been established that the federal government should not engage in activities that could jeopardize species' survival or destroy habitat they need to survive and recover.  <br/><br/>Specifically, the Biden administration must rescind the addition of “as a whole” to section 402.02. This Trump-era language created an enormous loophole, inconsistent with the intent of the Endangered Species Act itself. The nefarious “as a whole” language is a free pass to destroy critical habitat as long as the total destruction of a species’ entire critical habitat is avoided. This is especially damaging for wide-ranging and migratory species, from piping plover to marbled murrelet, from salmon to lynx. This language also ignores the cumulative impact of different causes of habitat destruction over time. And it goes against the science-based establishment of critical habitat to ensure both the species survival and recovery, instead treating some areas of critical habitat as expendable.   <br/><br/>Additional definition changes from the Trump era that need to be reversed include one that creates unnecessary confusion when examining an agency action that is ongoing, or a continuation of past activities as opposed to something new (“environmental baseline” section 402.02).   <br/><br/>Additionally, you must reverse Trump’s damaging changes in section 424.11(e) that allow plants and animals to be prematurely delisted. It is essential that species recovery meets all science-based standards before removing the backstop of Endangered Species Act protections that have kept so many species alive.  <br/><br/>Each of the many changes to Endangered Species Act regulations made by the Trump administration weakened protections for threatened and endangered species at a time when we must be doing everything in our power to fight the biodiversity crisis and recover species from the brink of extinction. Despite the broad support for restoring and strengthening the rules that implement the Act, you’ve left multiple loopholes from the Trump-era rollbacks in place, which will undoubtedly jeopardize future efforts to protect wildlife and habitat. By failing to fully restore the Endangered Species Act rules, you've left a significant job less than half done. Now is the time to get this right; we have no more time to waste.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Thomas Keydel<br/>95 Prince St  Jamaica Plain, MA 02130-2725

INFO - Comment: Re: ATF 2021R-08 <br/> <br/>ATF must immediately withdraw its Proposed Rule entitled Factoring Criteria for Firearms With Attached "Stabilizing Braces." <br/> <br/>ATF has approved the use of "a shooting support with a pistol" since at least 2006. And ATF has been approving pistol-braced firearms and pistol brace accessories for sale since at least 2012. Now, pistol-braced firearms are abundant within the firearm community. <br/> <br/>A gun owner is sure to find them for sale at local gun stores and on the firing line at local pistol ranges. <br/> <br/>District of Columbia v. Heller and United States v. Miller protect my individual right to keep arms-especially those in common use for lawful purposes. <br/> <br/>ATF estimates that there are between 3,000,000 to 7,000,000 pistol braces and pistol braced firearms in circulation. However, a Congressional Research Service report recently put out a more accurate estimate that there are perhaps upwards of 40,000,000 pistol braces and pistol-braced firearms in common use. <br/> <br/>Law enforcement should not spend their time infringing on the constitutional rights of citizens by measuring barrel lengths, overall length, and checking ATF guidance documents to figure out whether gun owners should be able to keep their legally purchased and ATF-approved pistol braces and braced firearms. <br/> <br/>This proposed rule change is unacceptable, a violation of the statutes at hand, and a violation of my Second Amendment rights! It must be withdrawn immediately.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Cardona,<br/><br/>I write to comment on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by the U.S. Department of Education to rescind regulations related to religious student organizations at certain public institutions of higher education, known as the “Free Inquiry Rule.” The changes proposed by this administration would remove protections put in place to prevent institutions of higher education (IHE) that receive federal grants from discriminating against any religious student organization based on the religious student organization’s beliefs. The changes proposed by this administration fails to reinforce First Amendment protections and would leave religious student groups more vulnerable to discrimination.<br/><br/>The “Free Inquiry Rule” is a common-sense protection that reinforces First Amendment rights. The Department of Education should rightly reinforce these constitutional rights. The fact that the Department is seeking to rollback these protections is gravely concerning. <br/><br/>With free speech and religious freedom under attack on college campuses across America, we need the protections provided by the “Free Inquiry Rule” now more than ever. Religious student groups on university campuses, including religious minorities, too often face the risk of being shut down or “canceled” by fellow students or school officials for expressing sincerely-held beliefs perceived to be controversial. <br/><br/>The administrators of institutions of higher education must be given clear guidance from the Department of Education that discrimination against religious student groups may not be tolerated. The Biden administration must protect students’ rights to free speech and free exercise of religion.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I hope you will not rescind the regulation.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mrs. Sylvia W Boling<br/>2337 Old Cedartown Rd SE, Lindale, GA 30147

INFO - Comment: To Whom It May Concern:<br><br><br/><br/>While I appreciate that the Department of the Interior finally released a proposed 5-year offshore leasing program after a long delay, I am concerned the program falls far short of what is needed to meet our country's energy needs. I'm particularly concerned that the new program leaves open the possibility that there will be no new oil and natural gas lease sales over the next five years, during a time in which energy prices are rising, global supply chains are being disrupted, and inflation remains at historic levels.<br><br/><br/>This is a serious economic risk for millions of American families. It's much harder to have affordable energy if we restrict access to the vast resources we have here at home. Unfortunately, that's what's happened with the recent cancellation of new lease sales and could continue if the no lease sale option is chosen in the Department's Final Program.<br><br><br/><br/>It's also a jobs issue. Offshore leasing accounts for over 300,000 jobs in the Gulf of Mexico, contributing billions to the economy and local, state, and federal tax revenues. Are you really willing to risk these tremendous benefits and instead rely more on foreign sources of energy to meet our domestic needs? I certainly hope not.<br/><br><br><br/><br/>I am encouraging the Department to quickly finalize its 5-year Program and move forward with the option that allows for the maximum number of lease sales during that time frame. These sales will help the United States continue its energy leadership, support good-paying jobs, and meet domestic energy demand with resources produced right here.<br><br><br/>Thank you, and I look forward to the Department quickly finalizing a robust five-year program for offshore natural gas and oil leasing. We cannot afford to wait any longer.<br><br><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br><br/>Ramona Estrada <br><br><br/><br/>https://d2w65gvskqg4cz.cloudfront.net/static/supportamericanenergysubmission.html<br/><br><br>

INFO - Comment: Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers. <br><br>The ATF's proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized. <br><br>1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale-or no sale at all-might require a license:<br><br>ATF's rule claims that the agency has opted not to "establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year" that require licensure, and instead suggests that "even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."<br>However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who "regular[ly]" and "repetitive[ly]" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple "firearms." <br><br>2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:<br><br>Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted "occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby." According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be "engaged in the business" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF's rule provides no such assurances.<br><br>3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:<br><br>Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer-privat gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court's Caniglia decision in 2021. <br><br>In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called "welfare check." But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police-and the Biden administration-with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.<br><br>4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:<br><br>One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have "willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license." Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior. <br><br>Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF's footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don't! <br><br>5. ATF's backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration: <br><br>So-called "Universal Background Checks" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime. <br><br>The Biden Administration described this as "moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation." And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales. <br><br>But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Becerra,<br/><br/>I write to comment on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families, “Safe and Appropriate Foster Care Placement Requirements for Titles IV-E and IV-B” (RIN: 0970-AD03).<br/><br/>This rule would impose an ideological agenda on the foster care system, to the detriment of children and the exclusion of people of faith. In the name of affirming adult choices, the rule would significantly reduce resources for children by falsely labeling people and religious organizations “unsafe” and “inappropriate.”<br/><br/>The proposed rule would force states to screen foster parents and foster-care organizations, making sure that they will “affirm” LGBT identities of children in their care, in the name of ensuring “safe and appropriate” care. But affirming a child’s self-proclaimed sexual identity, without regard for his or her sex, is harmful, and requiring it will exclude good people and organizations from helping kids struggling with their gender or sexual identity in an already over-taxed system. The new criteria would disqualify most faith-based providers from serving these kids and would essentially label people of faith and religious organizations “unsafe”!<br/><br/>This rule is predicated upon at least two false premises. First, it uncritically accepts the assertion that we must “affirm” a child’s sexual identity or risk pushing them toward suicide. Increasingly, there is better evidence that shows “gender affirming care” is causing more mental health distress rather than resolving it.<br/><br/>In fact, high-quality studies show that completed suicides do not go down when people are “affirmed” in a transgender identity, and that the overwhelming majority of children who are not “affirmed” in a transgender identity desist by the time they go through puberty—up to 70 percent of girls, and up to 98 percent of boys. It is essential to note the other increased risk factors for suicide that have been cited in the transgender-identifying population, namely a significantly greater incidence of adverse childhood experiences. A recent study, for example, from the pro-LGBT Williams Institute showed 45 percent of transgender identifying people reported childhood sexual abuse, 44 percent of transgender-identifying people reported childhood physical abuse, and fully 75 percent of transgender-identifying people reported childhood emotional abuse.<br/><br/>For the trauma survivor, an ideology that suggests a child can be born in the wrong body, unfortunately, fits hand-in-glove with the mentality of a person who self-harms and wants to dissociate from any aspect of their being or body that highlights vulnerability. Yet, despite this knowledge, clinical settings and research studies promoting transgenderism have not properly accounted for this significant variable and how it relates to gender dysphoria. These three resources explore these problems in greater detail: “Suicide Risk and Gender Transition: The Facts” (https://www.frc.org/blog/2021/07/suicide-risk-and-gender-transition-facts), “Do Not Sterilize Children: Why Physiological Gender Transition Procedures for Minors Should Be Prohibited” (https://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF20J34.pdf), and “The Trans Youth Phenomenon: Critiques & Hard Questions” (https://www.frc.org/booklet/the-trans-youth-phenomenon-critiques-hard-questions).<br/><br/>Second, it labels any foster-care family or institutional provider "unsafe” and “inappropriate.” This is dangerous ground both legally and practically. Legally, it infringes on the right of people of faith to continue to make an outsized contribution providing homes and services to children in the foster-care system. Practically, it threatens to dramatically restrict the number of homes and service providers available to help children in an already strained system.<br/><br/>Foster care agencies have already been affected by challenges to the religious freedom of providers or foster families. This rule will further discourage religious families and individuals from applying to be foster parents or seeking employment in the foster-care profession. Religious people who worry that their sincerely held religious beliefs are deemed to not be “safe and appropriate” by the federal government are likely to think twice before entering the child welfare system. We need more, not fewer, loving families to open their homes for children in the child welfare system, and more, not fewer, individuals to dedicate their lives to helping these children. HHS should not be applying pressure on state agencies to discourage faith-based providers and religious families.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this rule will only harm, not help, children in foster care. For these reasons, I oppose implementation of this rule.

IREC is a global competition fostering the next generation of aerospace leaders through hands-on experience in designing and launching amateur rockets. The proposed rule, as written, would impose significant new burdens that could limit U.S. educational opportunities and international participation, without advancing U.S. critical military advantages. Specifically, I request the following changes: <br/><br/>To the definition of Amateur Rocket: <br/><br/>Materials: Explicitly permit commonly used, non-sensitive materials like carbon fiber and composite materials to align with modern technology. <br/>Active Controls: Replace with the term "Targeting Functions" to differentiate from academic controls terminology. Clarify that simple altitude control mechanisms, such as airbrakes, are not targeting functions and should remain uncontrolled. <br/>Propellant Mass Limit: Delete the 5 pound propellant mass limit. This is duplicative, yet significantly more restrictive, than the 40,960 Ns total impulse limit already included. This clause significantly increases the USML's scope of control compared to today's regulations. <br/>To the definition of Amateur Rocket Motor: <br/><br/>Propellant Mass: Replace the proposed 5-pound propellant mass with a total impulse limit of 40,960 Ns, which is already a widely recognized performance standard. If a propellant mass limit must be retained, increase it to 50 pounds to align with existing commercial products of similar impulse. <br/>NFPA Certification: Delete reference to NFPA Certification. This consumer safety standard has no bearing on export control, and invoking it controls all university research rocket motors, no matter how small. <br/>Without these revisions, the proposed rule risks stifling innovation, burdening educational institutions, and discouraging student participation in programs that inspire future aerospace leaders. By making these changes, the Department can ensure that the proposed rule supports safe, educational rocketry while maintaining U.S. critical military advantages. Thank you for considering this feedback.

INFO - Comment: From:Diane Luck To:2019-NPRM-PaydayReconsideration Sent:4/23/2019 11:16:07 AM Subject:RIN 3170-AA80: Please do not to repeal the 2017 payday loan rule. Dear Director Kraninger, I am concerned that the CFPB has proposed to rescind its 2017 final rule on payday loans. The 2017 compromise was an essential consumer protection that placed safeguards on unaffordabl e short-term balloon payment loans while still allowing for consumers to have access to credit, including longer-term installment loans and lines of credit. Millions of American consumers struggle to meet their expenses and turn to loans that offer quick and easy cash. Unfortunately, the typical payday loan takes up a third of a borrower’s next paycheck, while the typical auto title loan takes up half of a borrower’s monthly income. As a result, most borrowers are not able to repay the loan quickly and therefore continually reborrow the money. Because lenders have access to borrowers’ checking accounts on payday or their car titles, lenders have the ability to collect even though most borrowers do not have the means to repay. That is why the payday loan rule is so important: to protect consumers from abuses in the market that they cannot reasonably avoid when they are in dire financial straits. Repealing the payday rule would take away vital consumer protections that millions of borrowers need so that there are safeguards on harmful balloon payment loans with 400 percent APRs. The ability to repay rule should remain in place because it creates a level playing field so more responsible and transparent lenders are not put at a competitive disadvantage. I implore you to maintain the ability to repay provisions of the 2017 rule so that borrowers will gain both protections and access to better credit options with affordable payments. Sincerely, Diane Luck Portland, Oregon 97212

The final Organic Livestock and Poultry Practices rule was the product of years of inclusive deliberation on the part of farmers, consumers, retailers and policy makers. The final rule evens the playing field for farmers, brings the organic standards in line with consumer expectations, and will improve the lives of some 50 million animals each year. As a citizen and consumer, these two issues are very important to me.  Please do not undo the work which has been accomplished and which is so important to a large body of Americans.  I urge you to pass the final Organic Livestock and Poultry Practices Rule.  Thank you for your consideration.

INFO - Comment: Dear Director Stone-Manning,<br/><br/>I urge the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to use this proposed rulemaking to prioritize conserving our public lands for the benefit of people, wildlife and the climate.<br/><br/>For far too long, BLM has focused on development and resource extraction — in fact, 90% of BLM lands remain open to oil and gas leasing. This imbalance is grossly incompatible with current U.S. climate and conservation goals. The prioritization of resource extraction is actively contributing to the climate crisis; use of lands for unregulated motorized recreation is destroying critical wildlife habitat and damaging important Indigenous cultural sites. <br/><br/>The agency must rebalance its management of public lands. By shifting the agency’s focus to prioritize conservation, BLM can take bold action to protect imperiled wildlife, preserve vanishing cultural sites and protect vital natural resources like carbon sinks and water supplies in the era of climate change. In fact, recent polling found that 82 percent of voters in the West support the goal of conserving 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030, and four-in-five say loss of open natural areas is a problem. <br/><br/>During the White House Conservation in Action Summit, President Biden reflected that our conservation work is critical for providing a bridge to our past and future. Failure to prioritize conservation of the lands you manage now will surely burn that bridge for generations to come.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Donald McKnew<br/>101 Watkins Pond Blvd Apt 402 Rockville, MD 20850-5636<br/>dmcknew@yahoo.com

INFO - Comment: To whom it may concern:<br><br><br/><br/>I am writing to encourage the Department of the Interior to move forward with a robust oil and natural gas leasing program for the Gulf of Mexico. While I understand there has been some progress on new lease sales, it's up to the Department to ensure we are fully developing the resources we have here at home to meet the energy needs of our fellow citizens.<br><br><br/><br/>I am particularly concerned that one of the Department's options is moving forward with no new additional lease sales over the next 5 years. This would be devastating for a region that produces more than 15% of America's oil. One estimation determined a 5-year lapse in lease could mean 885,000 fewer barrels of oil per day by 2036. If we think the cost of energy is bad now, I can only imagine what it would be if we fell even further behind in domestic production.<br><br><br/><br/>The Department of the Interior is charged with responsibly managing our public lands and waters. This means balancing environmental protection and resource development. Fortunately, the oil and natural gas produced in the Gulf of Mexico has some of the lowest carbon-intensity in the world. Not to mention, U.S. environmental standards are far superior to many oil-producing regions in the world.<br><br><br/><br/>You have the opportunity to increase American energy production at a time in which we desperately need it - and do it responsibly.

In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.—70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll—support cannabis legalization. <br/><br/>But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. <br/><br/>The criminalization of cannabis—a legacy of the War on Drugs—was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It’s time to abandon this draconian approach. I support descheduling cannabis from the CSA—a step toward righting the wrongs of its criminalization.<br/><br/>And for all those who need it for their own health reasons. Cannabis is five times more safer than any prescription drug out there. You could be helping me people like me go from 12 different prescriptions and cutting it in half or even a third.

Then it should be granted a meeting time with the empolyees (all of them in attendance so maybe more than one meeting) during which it can present its case and pass out brochures, etc stating its desires. Then after a suitable time the vote should be taken, but not as proposed i.e. with no time for discussion and thought on the subject by employees.  There should be no dissemination of employee's personal information at all outside of the work place.   Granted an employer has the workers data but out side of a special meeting called so the company can discuss its views of this labor organization effort, the company should have no contact with the employee in order to influence the unionization effort.  The card check program is truly a scam and should never become a rule.

I want to have the ability to comment on decisions affecting places I care about in the future. The current proposal would fundamentally change the relationship between the U.S. Forest Service and the public, cutting our voices entirely out of how to manage these special places.<br/><br/>I often visit our national forests to appreciate nature  spend time in the outdoors  create memories with my family and friends  enjoy the scenery  hike  swim  fish  backpack  camp  explore new places  relax  watch wildlife  picnic  and enjoy access to public lands. My uses of national forests could be harmed by large logging projects, new roads, pipeline and utility rights of way. The public deserves the chance to raise issues or concerns so that those harms can be avoided. <br/><br/>I am most alarmed that the rule proposes to allow large logging projects and other decisions to happen behind closed doors. The Forest Service should strengthen public involvement and focus on broadly supported work rather than attempting to bypass accountability for decisions that sacrifice the overall wellbeing of our national forests.

INFO - Title: Comment from Hebeisen, Brian
INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Debra Haaland,<br/><br/>I am writing to you today to express my opposition to Gulf-wide leasing in the oil and gas lease sales 259 and 261. <br/><br/>The Inflation Reduction Act does not require the administration to lease the entire Western and Central Gulf. Nor does it mandate any particular results from those sales. Rather, Congress, through both the IRA and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, empowered Interior to determine the size, location, and conditions for offshore leasing sales and preserved Interior’s authority to decide whether to issue a lease. And BOEM has the obligation to make those decisions based on a full evaluation of the environmental effects that leasing will cause – including climate pollution, oil spills, and harms to the critically endangered Rice’s whale. <br/><br/>There is simply no need for BOEM to continue with the large-scale lease sales we saw for four years under the Trump administration. Oil companies currently hold close to 1,900 leases covering more than 10 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico. Only about 500 of those leases are currently in production, meeting the current demand for offshore oil and gas and leaving more than 7.4 million leased acres (or 75% of current lease holdings) remaining to be developed to meet any near or mid-term national energy needs. <br/><br/>Moreover, massive area-wide lease sales are fundamentally incompatible with the Biden administration’s commitments to fight climate change. Decisions we make now about additional leases have no effect on current or even near-term energy needs because new leases typically take a decade to produce any oil. And because of the long-term nature of oil and gas development, leasing now locks in investments in fossil fuels for decades to come, long after the time when the United States and the world must transition to a clean energy economy if we are to avoid the more catastrophic impacts of climate change.   <br/><br/>Finally, continuing with massive leases sales increases the already dire harm to Gulf wildlife – like the 50 remaining critically endangered Rice’s whale – and to Gulf communities, which have disproportionately borne the brunt of the country’s fossil fuel addiction for far too long. Locking in new leases means locking in continued harm for decades to come and will only slow the needed rapid phase-out of fossil fuel from the nation’s energy portfolio.   <br/><br/>I urge you to not sell off millions of acres of Gulf leases and to use your authority and ample discretion to instead accelerate the rapid transition to the clean energy future the country needs!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Brian Hebeisen<br/>Watertown, MA 02472

INFO - Comment: As a small-business operator in Ohio, I'm very disappointed to learn that the FDA is considering a ban on licensed retailers selling menthol cigarettes to adults 21 and older. Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning menthol cigarettes could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since menthol cigarettes alone make up 36% of all cigarette sales in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of menthol could undermine my ability to operate by significantly impacting my revenue. Plain and simple: it's misguided and could force small businesses to close.<br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, menthol cigarettes could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime under the laws of all 50 states.  Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of menthol cigarettes is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.<br/>

INFO - Comment: Thank you for this opportunity to provide input regarding possible future regulations to better protect the animals covered under the Animal Welfare Act. I have concerns about several of the issues covered by this ANPR.<br/><br/>• Public handling of wild and exotic animals at licensed exhibitors should be banned. There should be no full-contact activities, no protected contact activities, no performances, no elephant rides, no feeding of animals, and no "swim-with" programs.<br/><br/>• The elimination of all public handling makes it unnecessary to categorize animals according to the risk they present to humans. Such a classification system is also based on a faulty premise. It fails to take into consideration the danger that humans pose to animals by, for example, causing stress or exposing them to disease. The only way to minimize risk of harm to the animals and promote their welfare is to prohibit public contact entirely.<br/><br/>• History has shown that performance standards do not work, so the USDA should establish specific, visible, and measurable standards for environmental enrichment. Such standards should be science-based and species-specific, and each animal should have sufficient space to perform normal behaviors and take advantage of environmental enrichment. There should be ongoing evaluation to ensure that enrichment plans are achieving their ends and that adjustments are made as needed.<br/><br/>• African and Asian elephants should not be kept on display in zoos in the United States. The best available science strongly indicates that keeping elephants in captive environments severely compromises their welfare. Zoo facilities cannot meet the species' complex biological, social, and cognitive requirements by adequately emulating wild habitats, diets, and social herd dynamics. There is no meaningful conservation benefit derived from relegating elephants to a lifetime in a captive environment that compromises their welfare.<br/><br/>• Before proceeding with any rule changes based on the ANPR, the USDA should issue the long-overdue update to its marine mammal regulations, which were withdrawn in 2017 with no further action since.<br/><br/>Until the USDA puts improved standards in place, it must do a better job of protecting animals with the existing regulations. Please cease allowing licensees who are habitually out of compliance from continuing in business and confiscate animals who are suffering as a result of abusive treatment.<br/><br/>Thank you.

We must turn declines around and ensure oceans of abundance.  Your agency has proposed a draft environmental review rule that could harm our fisheries. The following improvements should be made before this rule is finalized:  -- First, the draft rule should ensure decisions are made with the full understanding of environmental impacts and a full consideration of the public's views. Interested citizens like me, scientists, environmentalists, and fishermen all should have the opportunity to engage.  -- Second, NMFS should ensure that every fisheries management plan inclues a review of incentive-based "catch share" or "limited access privilege" programs as an alternative. Catch shares are proven win-win tools for ending overfishing, strengthening conservation and ensuring the long-term sustainability of America's fisheries.  Through careful management of America's fisheries, we can restore our marine resources and help America's fishing communities thrive. I urge you to rewrite the environmental review rule to protect the public's voice and promote better fisheries conservation.  Thank you for your consideration.

Four million patients depend on Title X for birth control, cancer screenings, STD testing and treatment, and other critical health care. We all deserve access to full information and care no matter how much money we make or where we live. I oppose any and all policies that interfere with access to basic preventive care and demand that HHS stops this rule now.

INFO - Comment: I urge the Department of Interior to issue concurrent, emergency Endangered Species Act protections while it completes its status review of wolves in the Northern Rockies and Western United States.<br/><br/>Montana has enacted policies allowing individuals to kill as many as TWENTY wolves each. In Idaho, there is no limit. The Department of Interior has a responsibility to prevent this species from being so radically mismanaged. <br/><br/>Already, at least 24 wolves from Yellowstone National Park have been killed, causing what National Park Service officials called a "significant setback."<br/><br/>Wolves can't wait for months. Please enact emergency protections for gray wolves while you complete the status review.

INFO - Comment: Dear Bureau of Land Management,<br/><br/>As a supporter of our national parks, I know how important it is for Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands to be protected and conserved. I am glad to see your proposed rule is focused on bringing conservation in line with the other uses of BLM lands. I agree that we need to have a health standard for the public lands to ensure natural and cultural resources and low-impact recreation opportunities are preserved, and part of planning and all decisions made by the agency.<br/><br/>As our climate continues to change, connected resources like wildlife habitat and river corridors will be increasingly important and require more management attention. I appreciate that the proposal provides a clear definition of an intact landscape which will lead to better planning in future decisions. The proposal should also lead BLM to actively designate areas where development is restricted or prohibited including Areas of Critical Environmental Concern and Wilderness Study Areas.<br/><br/>The BLM must be an agency of conservation action and resilience if we are going to maintain natural ecosystems and cultural landscapes across the country. I believe this proposed rule makes that possible.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my views.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms Chris  Quivers<br/>VA

INFO - Comment: As a United Association (UA) member for over 40 years, I know the training I received from the UA provided me the highest level of skill to do my job as a Pipefitter/Steamfitter safely. The UA's training program helped me get a good paying job and provided the benefits needed for health and retirement. I support the proposed construction exclusion from Industry Programs so that the next generation of construction workers will also have the benefit of training in a registered program keeping people safe and making certain that jobs are done right.<br/><br/>While rewarding in many ways, these job can be dangerous at times often working around heavy materials, in tight spaces and sometimes even around toxic substances. My registered apprenticeship program taught me the skills and safety training needed to keep me and my coworkers safe at work and the public safe from mistakes. Industry Programs could be dangerous in the construction industry, as there is nothing in the proposed rule that will require them to be held to the high set of standards my registered program required.<br/><br/>Registered apprenticeship programs such as the one provided by the UA, offer the best training in the construction industry. In both the classroom and on-the-job, these programs offer state-of-the-art construction skills training and the best safety training in the business. I worked hard to obtain journey-level status, but it was worth it. The skills learned have meant good pay, and the ability to provide for my family. If training programs with lesser standards required of registered programs are allowed, it would undermine the years of training and effort I, along with my fellow journeyworkers, have accomplished. High quality training works and keeps the projects we work on safe, secure and reliable.<br/><br/>The Department of Labor is right to exclude the construction industry from the Industry Program proposal. Existing registered apprenticeship programs ensure that apprentices receive excellent skills and safety training, which keep construction sites running efficiently and safely. Don't let an experimental system erode these standards and jeopardize safe jobsites and projects in our nation.<br/><br/>Frank Schuette

INFO - Comment: Attn: Docket No. CEQ-2019-0003<br/><br/>I am writing in support of the Administration's efforts to reform the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). For nearly four decades, NEPA's burdensome and overbearing regulations have held back American infrastructure, hurt our workers, and crippled small businesses across the country.<br/><br/>It's time for that to change. We must take advantage of the opportunity we have to modernize NEPA. Reforming NEPA would unleash American investment, create jobs across the country, and give a boost to our economy. <br/><br/>Right now, the United States ranks near the bottom in permitting among industrialized countries - 26 out of 33 - according to the World Bank's most recent 'Doing Business' study.<br/><br/>The Council on Environmental Quality's proposed reform would be a huge win for American workers and businesses across the country. It will reduce delays and uncertainties and lower the overall risk for companies - resulting in greater transparency and predictability for local governments and small businesses.<br/><br/>The list of stakeholders who would benefit is long. They include but are not limited to: state and local governments, infrastructure workers and the building trades, agriculture, clean energy, forestry, manufacturing, transportation, and small businesses.<br/><br/>The benefits of reforming NEPA are incalculable and we must act now. I strongly support the Council on Environmental Quality's proposed reforms.<br/><br/>Regards, <br/>Jasmine Jones<br/>43122 Calvary rd<br/>Hammond, LA, 70404 <br/>

The<br/>scientific evidence is overwhelming that rising temperatures will cause<br/>two-thirds of the world's polar bear populations, including all of<br/>Alaska's polar bears, to go extinct by 2050.

Their populations cannot<br/>afford to be hunted simply to meet the international demand for polar<br/>bear rugs.<br/><br/>Canada allows the killing of more than 300 polar bears every year,<br/>mostly for the sake of sport hunting and to feed the growing<br/>international demand for polar bear hides and parts.  Indeed, polar<br/>bear hides are fetching record prices and sport hunting is on the rise.<br/>Yet, despite the polar bear's precarious status, Canada is actually<br/>increasing its quotas for the hunting of polar bears in many regions.<br/><br/>That is why I applauded the Obama Administration's position at the last<br/>meeting of CITES, where the United States sponsored an urgently-needed<br/>proposal to ban the international commercial trade in polar bear parts.<br/>While that initial effort was not successful, now is the time to build<br/>momentum and achieve success at the next meeting of CITES in March<br/>2013.<br/><br/>Please sponsor a proposal for a ban, and then work with like-minded<br/>range states, such as Russia, to pass it for the sake of polar bear<br/>survival.<br/><br/>Thank you.

Bears Ears is one of our nation's newest monuments -- the American people are very lucky to now call this ancient site covering an expanse of 1.3 million acres a public resource protected for future generations. The monument protects ancient sites that are sacred to the Native American tribes in southern Utah's red-rock country. Utah is greatly enriched by the Bears Ears National Monument. Bears Ears National Monument also provides incredible spaces for outdoor activities-- it is one of best places in the world for rock climbing and bouldering. These public lands need to stay in public hands. No president has EVER attempted to abolish a national monument, and an attack on one park is an attack on all our parks. Secretary Zinke, I am adamantly opposed to any effort to eliminate or diminish protections for Bears Ears or any other national monument, and I urge you to support our public lands and waters and recommend that our current national monuments remain protected.

INFO - Comment: I am writing to voice my objection to the Covid vaccines being given to children under the age of 5 for the following reasons:<br/><br/>A check of the VAERS database alone shows that these vaccines have resulted in more deaths and severe adverse reactions than all other vaccines put together in the past 30 years, by a wide margin. https://openvaers.com/covid-data/mortality<br/>Of those reported deaths, 13 of them are in the 5 to 11 year old range. Data shows clearly that children are at almost zero risk from Covid, but they are dying and being injured by the vaccines. Administering these vaccines to young children will only result in further tragic deaths.<br/>The mRNA vaccines remain experimental and approved only for emergency use. If adults choose to take an experimental injection, that is up to them, but to push these injections upon young children who stand to get no benefit but potentially great harm or even death as a result is morally and legally completely unjustifiable.<br/>I wish to voice my objection to these vaccines being administered to any person of any age. In 1976 the U.S. rushed a swine flu vaccine. It was withdrawn after just 32 people died. With almost 30,000 reported deaths in the VAERS voluntary database alone, it is clear that these vaccines should not be administered to humans.<br/>

The proposed rule, however, sides with corporate interests -- pitting business owners against workers.  I would like to take a moment to officially register my opposition. We must strengthen -- not weaken -- our workforce laws and protections.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Increasingly, major corporations are working to dodge their obligation to follow labor laws by outsourcing employment to temp and staffing firms or other subcontractors, and creating the possibility that they can escape any liability for violations. This rule change, which would narrow the scope of the Fair Labor Standards Act, will confuse workers and embolden employers to outsource and then ignore their workers.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Simply put, joint-employer standards ensure workers have remedies against the contracting company for any legal violations.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to stand up for working people and fulfill its mission to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners  improve working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and assure work-related benefits and rights.  <br/><br/> <br/><br/>This proposed DOL rule change would redefine the joint employer standard and undermine the Labor Departments own stated goals by making it possible for the companies to avoid their liability by having contractors assume all responsibility for violations.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>mitch sanders<br/>sandersmitch@hotmail.com<br/>4304 Green Glade Rd<br/>Phoenix, Maryland 21131

INFO - Comment: I am writing to express my opposition to the proposed rule (FWS-HQ-ES-2019-0115) to revise Endangered Species Act (ESA) critical habitat regulations.<br/><br/>I ask that you withdraw the proposal, which would undermine the use of critical habitat designations to recover species. The rule would reverse existing U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service policy that favors establishing critical habitat on federal land, the land owned by all of us. This about face on policy will hurt species that depend on federal lands, like the polar bear, northern spotted owl, and the Gunnison sage grouse. I fear that this change is intended to help those that would exploit and damage federal lands, like loggers and drillers, at the expense of imperiled species and our planets biodiversity. <br/><br/>The proposal would also tip the scales on cost-benefit analysis, giving much more weight to costs to extractive and harmful industries, while ignoring the benefits to species. We know that when we save nature, we save ecosystem services, we protect our environment and our health, and we protect future generations. And yet, this rule would put the immediate economic costs of just a handful of individuals and corporations ahead of all that  including my family and my community. I do not agree with this change and I urge you to withdraw this proposal. <br/><br/>Habitat loss is the biggest threat to imperiled species, which means critical habitat designations are one of the most important protections we can preserve for species on the brink of extinction. There are a million species at risk of extinction, and we should be doing all we can to save them, instead of undermining the ESA. This proposed rule will weaken our ability to protect species, and for that reason I oppose this proposed rule and urge you to withdraw it.

I ask the U.S. Trade Representative to negotiate on behalf of American farmers to lower tariffs and open markets for our agricultural products.<br/><br/>Farmers are facing very difficult times. In fact, net farm income is down more than 50 percent - highlighting the importance of keeping the farm economy as strong as possible. We need to be able to export our excess products, and having open markets is critical. Government assistance will not make up for the long-term loss of global markets. And, as a farmer, I'd prefer to earn my income from the marketplace.<br/><br/>The tariffs race between the United States and China is very concerning. Consider that China is the second largest agricultural export destination for the United States, and the fifth largest for Pennsylvania. Raising tariffs on Chinese products, and prompting retaliation on American agricultural exports to China will have negative consequences on the farm economy.<br/><br/>Please oppose higher tariffs, and instead lower barriers to trade and open markets. It is only through negotiation - not a tariff race - that we can produce an agreement that serves the interests of both the United States and China.
