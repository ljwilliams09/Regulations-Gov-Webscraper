INFO - Title: Comment from Patel, Naren
INFO - Comment: As a small-business operator in Tennessee, I'm very disappointed to learn that the FDA is considering a ban on licensed retailers selling menthol cigarettes to adults 21 and older. Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning menthol cigarettes could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since menthol cigarettes alone make up 36% of all cigarette sales in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of menthol could undermine my ability to operate by significantly impacting my revenue. Plain and simple: it's misguided and could force small businesses to close.<br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, menthol cigarettes could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime under the laws of all 50 states.  Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of menthol cigarettes is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.<br/>

INFO - Comment: Alexander Acosta,<br/><br/>Back in 1975, President Gerald Fords Labor Department set the salary level for overtime exemption at the equivalent of about $58,000 in todays dollarshigh enough to cover more than 50 percent of full-time salaried workers. The Obama-era rule set it at $47,476high enough to cover about 34 percent of full-time salaried employees but lower than the level that it was in the 1970s. Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people. The whole point of having national standards is to ensure decent basic standards for all workers. The updated overtime standard is already linked to the lowest-wage Census region. Workers rights and wages should not be undercut even further by weakening the salary threshold.<br/><br/>Mark Lotito<br/>mrbad80@hotmail.com<br/>3 Raymond Court<br/>Garden City, New York 11530

INFO - Comment: Dear Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms,<br/><br/>I am writing in support of the ATF's proposed rule (Docket No ATF 2022R-17), which would dramatically reduce the number of guns sold without a background check.<br/><br/>I am writing in support of this proposed rule and urge ATF to finalize it as soon as possible. Guns sold without background checks—both online and at gun shows—are a huge source for gun traffickers and people looking to avoid a check. These guns often end up trafficked across state lines, recovered at crime scenes in major cities, and used against police officers. This contributes to the gun violence epidemic plaguing our country. The long-standing lack of clarity around which sellers must become licensed and run background checks has made this problem all the worse. <br/><br/>I support the clear common-sense standard laid out in this rule: Anyone offering guns for sale online or at a gun show is presumed to be trying to make a profit and should therefore be licensed and run a background check on their customers. This rule will save lives and should be urgently finalized.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Polly Beanch

Right now, states are withholding Title X federal family-planning money from these providers for ideological reasons, and women and families are suffering. Title X is a critical, lifesaving program that provides access to cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, birth control, well-woman visits, and more. We can't let political agendas cut women off from the care they need at the health centers they choose to visit, including Planned Parenthood. I applaud the Obama administration's new rule reinforcing existing protections for health care access and call for an end to these state-level attacks on women's health.

INFO - Comment: Acting Director, NMFS James Balsiger    Dear Acting Director, NMFS Balsiger,  I'm deeply concerned about the impact of your agency's fishery management decisions on ocean ecosystems. I believe that strong environmental review is critical to the health of our oceans.   The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has made it possible to protect thousands of square miles of deep sea coral formations, save the lives of endangered sea turtles, begin rebuilding of depleted fish populations and facilitate meaningful public participation in fisheries management.  Unfortunately your agency's proposed NEPA rule hands over too much authority to fishery management councils that have a long history of poor management, significantly limits the public's ability to participate in fishery management decisions, and allows fishery managers to make decisions without fully considering the impacts on marine ecosystems including sea turtles, seals, corals and other precious ocean life.  Please withdraw this flawed NEPA proposal and craft a new one that will ensure protection of our ocean ecosystems. Our oceans are in trouble. I've seen in my own life how decades of mismanagement have degraded the oceans. It's time for our nation's fisheries managers to make better decisions by fully understanding the consequences of fishing on marine ecosystems.  Thank you for your time and consideration.   Sincerely, darren new 476 bluff rd Melbourne 3188

This rule is a definite invasion of privacy.  Our family is involved in farming and livestock production.  A rule like this would threaten our privacy and biosecurity in our operations involving the livestock.  This information is already available to the EPA through other sources and I have a great concern about how this publically-accessible nationwide data base of information may be misused by groups that oppose livestock production.<br/><br/>I oppose this possible additional burden of reporting information, particularly when this information is already available through other sources.  The best way to improve environmental protection is to work with farmers voluntarily, on a watershed-by-watershed basis, not create a federal database that will cause nothing but problems and absolutely offer no solutions.<br/><br/>Thank you for you time and consideration in this matter, it is much appreciated.

The FDA should prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in animals that are not sick or injured. FDA should require drug makers to limit the use of antibiotics to under 21 days, consistent with FDA recommendations for new drug approvals. Finally, the FDA must speed up its timeline and make sure these changes are in place by 2025. <br/><br/>The FDA needs to act now and act quickly to make sure that no more people die unnecessarily from antibiotic-resistant superbug infections.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Louise Lord<br/>2505 Towergate Ct Apt 1 Winston Salem, NC 27106-2342

INFO - Comment: Do not pass unnecessary burden onto small local farmers, all quality issues I have ever had with poultry is undoubtedly from large scale factory farms and that is who needs more regulation<br/>Remove Component 1, which effectively imposes testing requirements on poultry farmers for each flock that is brought to a slaughter facility. FSIS should not use its authority over processors to create new burdens on farmers. This provision is blatantly prejudicial to small-scale farmers and homesteaders and the independent small processors who process for them.<br/>Remove Component 3 until and unless the agency provides a clear statement of what levels and what strains of salmonella would be involved. The component currently provides that FSIS will declare salmonella an adulterant in raw poultry based on a certain enumerated level AND/OR the detection of particular strains of concern. In other words, as currently proposed, the agency might declare that infectious levels of the 4-5 strains most likely to cause serious illness are adulterants, which would be reasonable. Or the agency might declare that any levels of any strain of salmonella are adulterants, which would be a completely unreasonable position. Until the agency provides some sort of specificity, stakeholders have no way to meaningfully comment.<br/>Conduct a full analysis of the impact of any new regulations on small plants. Costs imposed on small plants should be considered not only an issue from the perspective of harming small businesses, but an issue for food safety. Small processors are an integral part of a decentralized, localized food system, which provides a safer and more secure food supply for consumers. Thus, regulations that harm small processors reduce the overall safety and security of our food supply. Simply proposing to give small plants longer to comply isn’t a solution when the proposed regulations unduly burden small plants. In the absence of evidence or data showing that these small processors are the source of significant outbreaks, it is inappropriate to blindly impose the same requirements on them as on large processors.

Young clams may have a harder time finding suitable places to settle as a result.

The administration has no legal authority to simply create abortion requirements out of thin air.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the proposed regulations would impose an unconstitutional burden on freedom of religion because it has no substantial protections for religious beliefs. As a Catholic, I am dismayed that the administration is seeking yet again to force religious employers to cover abortion. This will subject churches and faith-based organizations to years of expensive litigation to reclaim their rights..<br/><br/>The proposed regulations must be revised to remove all references to abortion.<br/>

INFO - Comment: I'm writing to express my disappointment that U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and gas leasing has been allowed to lapse and urge a resumption of lease sales as part of the proposed 2023-2028 National Outer Continental Shelf Program. I ask that the Department of the Interior finalize the program with the maximum lease sales as soon as possible. Regular leasing in the Gulf of Mexico is vital to maintaining a reliable supply of U.S.-produced energy in the coming years and preserving our energy and economic security.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, we have seen this year what happens to prices at the pump and our economy when we do not produce enough energy. It is particularly frustrating given the U.S. has abundant natural resources along with the expertise and workforce ready to find and produce those resources. In addition, we do it safer and with lower emissions than almost anyone else in the world because U.S. regulators enforce strict safety and environmental standards.<br/><br/>Virtually everyone supports a cleaner energy future. But it cannot be achieved without an existing abundant, reliable, and lower-cost energy supply that ensures we can maintain our current quality of life. Major economic forecasts, including those from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, acknowledge that oil and gas will be needed to meet energy demand for many decades to come. It is illogical to penalize American companies and workers while buying oil and gas from countries abroad---countries who may or may not be our allies, and who may or may not have the same environmental and safety standards we do---to meet U.S. energy demand.<br/> <br/>Whether Democratic or Republican, past administrations understood the critical importance of U.S. offshore oil and gas, which is why they maintained offshore leasing programs and held regular lease sales. I ask that the Biden administration choose domestic energy, choose economic and geopolitical stability, and let the U.S. control our own energy future: Resume domestic oil and gas leasing in the Gulf of Mexico to the maximum number of 10 lease sales as part of the next 5-year program.

INFO - Comment: I am concerned with this administration’s attempt to dismantle the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  <br/><br/>NEPA is the people’s environmental law. It gives communities the opportunity to have a voice in projects that impact their communities, health, and lives.  NEPA helps communities protect their access to clean air, clean water, and land free from pollution and contaminants.   <br/><br/>These recent actions undercut recent changes to NEPA that brought greater certainty to the process. Eliminating CEQ’s regulations and relying on the interpretation of each individual federal agency involved in NEPA implementation will only cause chaos and further prolong project approvals.   <br/><br/>Simultaneously prohibiting federal agencies from considering environmental justice in the NEPA process will further entrench pollution in some of our most vulnerable communities while failing to ensure our infrastructure is resilient in the face of numerous climate threats.  <br/><br/>Eliminating all rules that implement NEPA won’t improve decision-making or make the government more effective-especially as the Trump administration fires large numbers of federal workers from the agencies tasked with implementation.   <br/><br/>When governments are required to engage with communities and analyze and disclose foreseeable impacts of projects, all of us benefit.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>marilyn ACTION ALERT brenneman<br/>Colorado Springs, CO

INFO - Comment: I am writing today in opposition to the US Fish and Wildlife Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations  proposed rule to rescind the longstanding regulatory definition of harm under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Eliminating the regulation is a reckless attempt to strip away vital protections against injury from habitat modification. This change is counter to the best available science regarding species recovery and not consistent with the text, purpose, and legislative intent of the ESA. For half a century, the current definition of harm has clearly and correctly implemented the protections required by the ESA.   <br/><br/>The proposed action is a blatant attempt to pave the way for timber, oil, mining and other extractive industries  to destroy habitat where endangered species live, even if the damage causes death or injury to members of the species.   <br/><br/>As the extinction crisis continues, now more than ever, it is critical that the federal government use the powers of the ESA to protect and restore biodiversity through the protection and preservation of habitat.  This attempt to undermine ESA implementation will only exacerbate the extinction crisis.

INFO - Comment: I oppose the proposed rule withdrawing CEQ's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing regulations. CEQ's NEPA regulations provide certainty to project sponsors, impacted communities, and over 85 federal agencies. By requiring implementing regulations from each agency, this rule will delay projects, increase compliance costs, reduce transparency, and worsen environmental outcomes for birds and communities. <br/><br/>I have serious concerns about removing the requirement to assess cumulative impacts, which is firmly rooted in the statutory text of NEPA. Without this analysis, agencies may make decisions which on their own do not pose serious environmental risks, but taken together are environmentally detrimental. This change undermines consideration of project contributions to large-scale environmental problems, like climate change or deforestation. With 3 billion birds lost from North America in the last 50 years and nearly two-thirds at risk from climate change, this is no time to ignore the effects of decisions. Any rule barring cumulative analysis is unlawful. <br/><br/>This rule limits consideration of project impacts on communities who are adjacent or downwind of proposed projects, which will reduce public input and result in adverse effects for families, communities, and Tribes, running afoul of the principles affirmed in NEPA. <br/><br/>Finally, I am deeply concerned about allowing private entities to prepare environmental review documents without sufficient oversight. This will reduce the objectivity of environmental reviews, threatening birds and critical ecosystems.  <br/><br/>NEPA is a bedrock environmental law that informs science-based, transparent, and accountable decision-making. This proposed rule would weaken those vital standards. Thank you for considering my comments.

In fact, consumers like me intentionally choose these products because they are better for our health, the environment, and animals. <br/><br/>The beef industry is simply attempting to use the USDA to suppress growing competition and disadvantage emerging industries. If anything, the USDA should use its limited resources to address real mislabeling issues, like using "natural" and other blatantly misleading terms to market factory-farmed meat.<br/><br/>For all these reasons, I respectfully ask you to reject the U.S. Cattlemen's petition.

Specifically, I strongly support the proposal to allow Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) to provide the pre-anesthetic assessment in Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) as part of the Conditions for Coverage (CfC). <br/><br/>This change would relieve ASC regulatory burden associated with operating the Medicare program, reduce healthcare costs, and ensure patient safety. CRNAs are highly educated anesthesia experts who are fully qualified to provide the pre-anesthesia assessment. In fact, performing the pre-anesthetic assessment and evaluation of the risk of anesthesia is within the scope of practice of a CRNA. <br/><br/>This proposal would align the anesthetic risk and pre-surgery evaluation standard with the post-anesthetic evaluation standard and would promote continuity of care for the patient by allowing "the patient's anesthesia professional to have familiarity with the patient's health characteristics and medical history."  <br/><br/>In many facilities, CRNAs may be the only anesthesia providers, and, therefore, the only healthcare professionals possessing the expertise and training to perform the pre-anesthetic evaluation. Modification of this requirement would promote efficiency and flexibility in ASCs and will reduce administrative burden.<br/><br/>I routinely do now and have done for many years, my own pre-anesthesia evaluations on my patients who will be undergoing procedures while under my care. <br/><br/>This is the right proposal for patients and for the healthcare system, and I urge you to ensure that it is included in the final rule.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mark Odden<br/>17893 224th St<br/><br/>Manchester, IA 52057-8629  <br/>

We are calling on you to urgently create a strong, lasting national rule that protects mature and old-growth trees and forests across federal lands from the threat of logging. Protecting and recovering these natural climate solutions would be a crucial piece of U.S. climate policy.  <br/><br/>Safeguarding and expanding carbon-rich forests on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands is one of the most important, cost-effective, and timely approaches to fighting the climate crisis. Mature trees store and continue to absorb large amounts of carbon in addition to providing the public with clean drinking water, habitat for imperiled wildlife, and world-class recreational opportunities. Larger, older trees are also far more fire resistant, and a well-constructed rule would not preclude necessary, science-based efforts to address the risk of fire.   <br/><br/>Unfortunately, vital mature forests and trees on federal lands are currently threatened by numerous proposed and ongoing logging projects, in spite of President Biden’s executive order to conserve them. We need to ensure America's mature and old-growth trees and forests remain in place to mitigate climate change, and to maintain their natural benefits for future generations. Thank you for your leadership on these important issues.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Aaron Wagner<br/>Verona, KY 41092<br/>awagner509@gmail.com

INFO - Comment: The notice-and-takedown process under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is heavily biased in favor of corporate copyright holders and too commonly used to censor content that is protected under fair use. This system has had dire effects on political expression, creativity, and commercial innovation on the Internet. The DMCA needs new safeguards to protect against abuse and companies that infringe on users' free speech need to be held responsible.<br/><br/>Under a court sanction (Lenz v. Universal Music) companies are able to use computer algorithms to scan content posted to the Internet for possible copyright violations and issue automated takedowns. This process is vulnerable to significant error and does not allow for judgements to be made about possible fair use exceptions, therefore resulting in the censorship of vast amounts of legitimate (i.e. legal) speech and creative expression on the Internet.<br/><br/>According to a recent study from Berkeley and Columbia law professors, nearly 30 percent of takedown notices are of questionable validity and would benefit from human review.<br/><br/>While the DMCA's safe harbor provisions are important for making an open, participatory Internet possible, the notice-and-takedown procedures that have been developed alongside them have disproportionately benefited corporate copyright holders and copyright trolls who seek to shut down legitimate competition and extract money from innocent victims.<br/><br/>The notice-and-takedown process puts the most important types of content at risk. Political speech can be censored at crucial moments in a campaign. Videos can be taken offline at moments when they are crucial for the survival of small businesses. This kind of damage can not be undone.<br/><br/>To balance the process, copyright holders need to have more responsibility for considering fair use when enforcing copyright laws. As sites like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter have become important public spaces, companies that issue takedown notices of content that is clearly protected by fair use should be held liable for violating individuals' rights to free speech.<br/><br/>Balance is desperately needed in the notice and takedown system. One step to creating that balance is to  impose statutory damages for companies that abuse the DMCA takedown process or fail to adhere to any fair use review. In particular, automated takedowns must be discouraged as they inhibit free speech and fair use of copyrighted works.

INFO - Comment: Thank you for rejecting the state petitions to delist grizzly bears from Endangered Species Act protections. The current science shows that the best way for the species to truly recover is to maintain federal protections under the ESA and manage the bears in a way that allows for natural connectivity between their existing habitats. The science shows that a unified population of grizzly bears is essential for their long-term recovery in the Northern Rockies.  <br/><br/>Even with federal protections, last year was the deadliest year for grizzly bears in the Northern Rockies. Bears were killed during surprise encounters with hunters or were exterminated over encounters with livestock or after rummaging through unsecured household trash. Others were hit by cars or trains. Some were electrocuted. A mother bear and two cubs drowned in a concrete drainage ditch. Still more were killed at the hands of poachers. <br/><br/>At least 90 grizzly bear deaths in the Northern Rockies last year were attributable to human causes. <br/><br/>The rising trend in grizzly bear deaths is largely due to the states adopting lethal anti-science policies that allow for the killing and “take” of more bears. Now the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is considering expanding on some of these types of regressive policies, even allowing for trophy hunting of grizzly bears. Virtually all leading grizzly bear biologists say this is counterproductive to the long-term recovery of grizzly bears on the landscape.  <br/><br/>Former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Grizzly Bear coordinator Dr. Christopher Servheen’s 2024 report (https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-12-11-usfws-grizzly-petition_with-exhibits.pdf) highlights the importance of fostering natural connectivity for grizzly bears between existing recovery areas. Grizzlies also need enhanced protections against lethal human activities, careful mortality management, and more resources and assistance to communities to reduce human/bear conflicts. <br/><br/>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service should reject any policy that allows for increased human-caused mortality risks like hunting of grizzly bears, or trapping other species, like wolves and coyotes in grizzly habitats.  <br/><br/> I urge the Service to follow the best available science and pass a 4(d) rule that promotes natural connectivity of grizzly bear populations, manages grizzlies as a unified metapopulation, and reduces human-caused threats and risks to their mortality.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Deb Muraro<br/>Dousman, WI

Designated under the Antiquities Act, the Papahnaumokukea, Pacific Remote Islands, Rose Atoll, Marianas Trench, and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monuments constitute the first generation of blue parks bestowed on our nation. <br/><br/>An attempt to roll back protections on any one of these monuments imperils our country's cultural and scientific legacy, and we strongly urge you to maintain the current protections for all marine national monuments. <br/><br/>The Antiquities Act, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906, safeguards and preserves U.S. public lands and waters that contain objects of historic or scientific interest. Sixteen past presidents - eight Republicans and eight Democrats - have used this authority to designate over 150 monuments, thereby preserving our special places at sea and on land for future generations of Americans.<br/><br/>Although two-thirds of the planet's surface is water, we have been slow to recognize the importance of protecting the marine environment. This is changing, thanks to U.S. leadership. Our diverse U.S. marine monuments protect a rich array of ocean species and their habitats, provide nursery and spawning habitats for commercially-valuable fish and crustacean populations, and offer sought-after recreational angling opportunities. Deep-sea ecosystems in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts are home to sperm whales, Atlantic puffins, and lush deep sea coral gardens, including one of the planet's oldest organisms, black corals, and other species that may contain chemical compounds of biomedical importance. The expansion of Papahnaumokukea prevents sharks, sea turtles, sea birds, and marine mammals from being caught by longline fishing and helps safeguard the traditional culture of the Native Hawaiian community.  <br/><br/>I am confident that your reviews pursuant to President Trump's executive orders will find each marine national monument was created or expanded squarely within the authority of the Antiquities Act, and each was established with broad public support and significant input from the local community. <br/><br/>I write to add my voice, to show that there is a strong desire from the public that the U.S. recognize the value of its diverse marine ecosystems, and not alter or eliminate any of the protections for the marine national monuments. <br/><br/>I urge you to support the following list of National Monuments and recommend that our current national monuments remain as they are today.  Please accept this letter as an official public comment for Docket No. DOI-2017-0002.<br/><br/>AMERICAN SAMOA<br/>Rose Atoll<br/><br/>HAWAII<br/>Papahnaumokukea<br/><br/>NEW ENGLAND<br/>Northeast Canyons and Seamounts<br/><br/>PACIFIC OCEAN<br/>Marianas Trench<br/>Pacific Remote Islands<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>B S<br/>  Weston, CT 06883

I treat everyone under my care to the very best care that can be given. If someone does not want to administer care to all, then they are in the wrong field and should leave the profession. Period. <br/><br/>This grant that allows one to selectively withhold care is an abomination and despicable. It is unconscionable that you even consider it. Throw it out and throw it out immediately. <br/>I urge you to reject the proposed changes to HHS grant regulations that would allow HHS grant recipients to discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community, women, and religious minorities.<br/><br/>These communities already experience greater obstacles to obtaining health services. They could risk losing access to crucial health care services altogether if federally funded health care providers choose to discriminate against them for their gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation.<br/><br/>Everyone, regardless of their background, deserves to be able to access health care that is safe and nonjudgmental.

INFO - Comment: I urge you to grant hippos crucial protection under the Endangered Species Act.  <br/><br/>Hippos are on the path to extinction, and protecting them under the Act can help. Hippo populations are decreasing and losing habitat _ and U.S. demand for their ivory, skins, trophies and other parts is accelerating their decline.  <br/> <br/>Following surging demand for hippo ivory as elephant ivory availability diminished, countries with hippos implemented patchwork regulations, with some countries banning trade and others not. Unfortunately, ongoing legal trade provides cover for illegal trade, making it essential to shut down demand. The Act will help protect hippos from commercial demand in the U.S. market for everything from wallets, belts and boots to jewelry and carvings.  <br/> <br/>Protection will also help raise awareness about hippos_ conservation needs and increase funding. This is more important than ever as people compete with hippos for habitat and water in the face of drought.  <br/> <br/>I want future generations to live in a world with hippos. I ask that you propose _ and promptly finalize _ their protection under the Endangered Species Act.

INFO - Title: Comment from Blackley, Michelle
INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Debra Haaland,<br/><br/>I am writing to you today to express my opposition to Gulf-wide leasing in the oil and gas lease sales 259 and 261. <br/><br/>The Inflation Reduction Act does not require the administration to lease the entire Western and Central Gulf. Nor does it mandate any particular results from those sales. Rather, Congress, through both the IRA and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, empowered Interior to determine the size, location, and conditions for offshore leasing sales and preserved Interior’s authority to decide whether to issue a lease. And BOEM has the obligation to make those decisions based on a full evaluation of the environmental effects that leasing will cause – including climate pollution, oil spills, and harms to the critically endangered Rice’s whale. <br/><br/>There is simply no need for BOEM to continue with the large-scale lease sales we saw for four years under the Trump administration. Oil companies currently hold close to 1,900 leases covering more than 10 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico. Only about 500 of those leases are currently in production, meeting the current demand for offshore oil and gas and leaving more than 7.4 million leased acres (or 75% of current lease holdings) remaining to be developed to meet any near or mid-term national energy needs. <br/><br/>Moreover, massive area-wide lease sales are fundamentally incompatible with the Biden administration’s commitments to fight climate change. Decisions we make now about additional leases have no effect on current or even near-term energy needs because new leases typically take a decade to produce any oil. And because of the long-term nature of oil and gas development, leasing now locks in investments in fossil fuels for decades to come, long after the time when the United States and the world must transition to a clean energy economy if we are to avoid the more catastrophic impacts of climate change.   <br/><br/>Finally, continuing with massive leases sales increases the already dire harm to Gulf wildlife – like the 50 remaining critically endangered Rice’s whale – and to Gulf communities, which have disproportionately borne the brunt of the country’s fossil fuel addiction for far too long. Locking in new leases means locking in continued harm for decades to come and will only slow the needed rapid phase-out of fossil fuel from the nation’s energy portfolio.   <br/><br/>I urge you to not sell off millions of acres of Gulf leases and to use your authority and ample discretion to instead accelerate the rapid transition to the clean energy future the country needs!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Michelle Blackley<br/>Auburn, IL 62615

INFO - Comment: Dear Sec. Haaland,<br/><br/>I urge you to drop the proposed new land exchange agreement that would allow a road to be constructed through the internationally-renowned Izembek Wilderness and National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. <br/><br/>A road cutting through the heart of this irreplaceable Wilderness would be catastrophic—Izembek is a migratory stopover for hundreds of thousands of birds and home to native wildlife such as brown bears, caribou, sea otters, and Stellar sea lions. Izembek deserves to be protected for all time; a road bisecting this special place would not only irreparably harm this Wilderness, but it would invite further, unending ORV trespass and associated damage into what is now a remote and protected place.<br/> <br/>Non-road alternatives for transportation between King Cove and Cold Bay are more reliable, less expensive, and won’t harm Izembek. A 2015 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers analysis that looked at three non-road alternatives—a 150-foot year-round ferry capable of moving through 12-inch-thick ice, a fixed-wing aircraft and new airport, and a helicopter/heliport—deemed a marine option most reliable. Not only would a ferry be dependable more than 99 percent of the time, it is no more cost-prohibitive than building and maintaining a road. Alternatively, upgrading existing medical facilities in King Cove is another more feasible option for dealing with emergency medical situations. <br/><br/>ANILCA does not allow for land exchanges to build roads. The unlawful pretense of first trading away land, then claiming the land is no longer federal, puts at risk every conservation system unit in Alaska. The idea that any Secretary of Interior can give away lands in any Wilderness, National Park, or National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska is a remarkable distortion of the purposes of ANILCA—which are clearly defined as conservation and subsistence—and sets a terrible precedent.<br/><br/>Our nation’s most prized wildlands must not be left to the whims of any future Secretary of Interior who might want to see these lands developed and desecrated. The land exchange must be rejected. A transportation option that doesn’t harm Izembek and its wildlife should instead be utilized.<br/><br/>Thank you.

In addition, the babies are stressed beyond belief as they are made to pose over and over and over, not getting enough rest, and inadequate nutrition to keep them healthy.

INFO - Comment: ATF authorized the first pistol brace products almost ten years ago.  These products provide an attachment to pistols that distributes weight of the pistol to the forearm and were designed to help disabled persons control and safely shoot brace-equipped pistols.<br/><br/>Guidance regarding the legality of braces and their features has been issued by ATF over the last 10 years. This guidance seemed to attempt to balance the needs of disabled persons with ATF’s desire to prevent the brace from being used as a stock, which in ATF’s view makes the braced device a rifle subject to the National Firearms Act, including its rules on transfer, the imposition of a $200 transfer tax, and restrictions on transport and possession.<br/><br/>These proposed rules utterly disrupt this balance and fly in the face of the purpose for which the brace was designed and sold.  The proposed rules are highly restrictive and would cause the vast majority of the millions of braced pistols in the hands of US citizens to be reclassified as NFA items.  This reclassification would impose incredible costs on US citizens who have purchased braces and braced products in the last ten years and significantly limit the future availability of these devices to the disabled community.<br/><br/>Worse is that the rule’s point criteria used to evaluate braced pistols to determine if they are pistols or NFA items penalize firearms with features that are useful to the disabled and have nothing to do with whether the brace acts as a stock.  Examples include restrictions on the minimum and maximum weights of braced firearms, and brace adjustability and attachment methods. Moreover, ATF ignores the benefits of features that are clearly beneficial to the disabled community, and instead based on unsupported conjecture proposes rules that these features (such as adjustability) define the brace as a stock, denying beneficial features and making the device less effective or unavailable to the disabled community.<br/><br/>ATF is prohibited from making such discriminatory rules under The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Section 504 states that “no… individual with a disability… shall be excluded from, denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any activity that… is conducted by any Executive agency.”  Here ATF’s rulemaking discriminates against disabled persons by arbitrarily limiting design characteristics that enhance the effectiveness of the brace design for the disabled person and for no discernible purpose. <br/><br/>The balance that previously existed in ATF’s pistol brace guidance and rulemaking has been lost.  We urge ATF to reconsider the proposed rule in order to make appropriate accommodations for the disabled, as originally intended and required by statute.<br/>

NEPA and its implementing procedures provide a strong foundation for informed, science-based decisionmaking.<br/><br/>NEPA is also an essential tool in the fight against environmental racism. NEPA promotes environmental justice by requiring federal agencies to include study and disclosure of a proposed project's potential environmental, economic, and public health impacts on low-income, minority, and rural communities. It also provides opportunities for meaningful input from those affected communities.<br/><br/>I urge the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to abandon this rulemaking process altogether. I also oppose any other changes to NEPA's implementing procedures that would in any way restrict public input, limit consideration of project alternatives, establish hard deadlines for project approval, or narrow or eliminate federal agencies' obligations to consider a project's climate impacts.<br/><br/>NEPA is democracy in action - it is one of the only laws that allows the public to provide input in decisions that affect the health and safety of their communities.

INFO - Comment: As a psychologist, I write to express my strong objections to President Trump's Executive Order (EO) No. 13950 titled "Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping", the associated Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memos, and the contents of this Request for Information (RFI). This RFI and the EO are premised on flawed assumptions and ignore the real benefits that evidence-based diversity training offers to employers and employees alike.<br/><br/>Contrary to the assumptions made by this RFI and the underlying EO, my experience with diversity training shows that it in no way seeks to engage in racial or sex stereotyping. <br/><br/>Rather than seeking to create "divisiveness in the workplace," diversity training seeks to promote a common understanding about implicit and explicit biases that already exist in the workplace. I have seen the benefits of such training to my patients and colleagues, and this RFI strikes me not as a true fact-finding effort, but as a means of confirming pre-existing assumptions underlying the EO.<br/><br/>Research on diversity trainings points to positive benefits of evidence-based diversity training programs. Social hierarchies - such as racism, sexism, heterosexism, ableism, and ageism - marginalize disadvantaged groups while unfairly benefiting others. These hierarchies minimize the value of marginalized populations and their contributions to their communities. The nation as a whole suffers when disadvantaged groups are unfairly prevented from reaching their full potential.<br/><br/>Research on diversity training is clear - high-quality, evidence-based trainings increase individuals' awareness of their own biases, and the ways in which inequities can be reinforced within institutions and systems. These trainings increase competitive advantages for businesses, improve intergroup interactions, increase opportunities for understanding diverse viewpoints, and improve conditions for learning. They also improve the quality of services delivered to diverse populations, such as in health care settings, and improve educational opportunities for all.  In so doing, diversity trainings have improved the functioning of public and private organizations, including government agencies. <br/><br/>The evidence of widespread promotion of race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating during diversity trainings, as described in the EO, is vague, lacks context and citation, and in my experience bears little resemblance to real-world evidence-based diversity training. Federal regulations must permit all executive departments and federal agencies to continue diversity training efforts to ensure the ongoing strength of our nation's federal workforce, contractors, grantees, and the military. Rather than silencing diverse perspectives on race, gender, and inclusion in society, we should focus on more research on and application of proven training strategies to promote equity, diversity, and inclusion, particularly in public-sector settings. I respectfully ask that this administration withdraw EO 13950 and encourage the use of evidence-based methods to continue improving the diversity and inclusiveness of the public and private workforce.<br/><br/>For additional information, please see the following resources: <br/>- Adam, E.

INFO - Comment: I commend the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for carefully considering the concerns of the homeopathy community and providing adequate time to provide comments and other input which reflect those concerns.<br/><br/>However, I remain troubled by the Draft Guidance on homeopathy released in October 2019 by the FDA. I therefore write to support the Citizen Petition submitted by Americans for Homeopathy Choice, the country's leading consumer homeopathy organization. The Petition is endorsed by 20 major homeopathy organizations across the United States.<br/><br/>The agency's Draft Guidance would create an enforcement regime that fails to distinguish between homeopathic medicines - which when properly manufactured and labeled are nontoxic and inherently safe - and improperly labeled products that do not meet homeopathic standards. <br/><br/>If adopted, this guidance could lead to the removal of many popular homeopathic medicines from the market. In the process, the FDA would be abandoning decades of practice and policy that treat homeopathic medicines as unique drugs requiring a unique approach to regulation. It is ironic that the FDA's actions would reduce consumer access to homeopathy -the safest category of drugs it regulates- and thereby force consumers to turn to pharmaceuticals which have significantly higher risks.<br/><br/>The Citizen Petition submitted under the federal Administrative Procedure Act by Americans for Homeopathy Choice requests that the FDA regulate homeopathy using the clear guidelines outlined in the Petition for protecting consumers from improperly manufactured and/or labeled products.<br/><br/>The Petition also outlines methods for assuring continuing access to the full range of nontoxic, affordable and safe homeopathic medicines on the market today. In addition, it seeks clear regulations for manufacturers that tell them what they should do in order to adhere to the law and meet the FDA's expectations for quality and purity. Right now, the FDA's proposed guidance provides no clear guidelines and so manufacturers are in the dark about the FDA's expectations.<br/><br/>Finally, the Petition provides a framework for moving genuine homeopathic medicines into the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States in a way that protects consumers and allows the expansion of homeopathic medicines available in the United States.<br/><br/>I urge the FDA to adopt the rule proposed in the Petition which would put homeopathy on a course that will ensure its safety and its continued availability to Americans who choose to make it part of their health care.

I strongly support the Council on Environmental Quality’s proposed reforms. <br/><br/>Regards, <br/>techniquee hines<br/>3217 Newtown Blvd<br/>Sarasota, FL, 34234 <br/>

The monument protects ancient sites that are sacred to the Native American tribes in southern Utah's red-rock country. Utah is greatly enriched by the Bears Ears National Monument. Bears Ears National Monument also provides incredible spaces for outdoor activities-- it is one of best places in the world for rock climbing and bouldering. These public lands need to stay in public hands. No president has EVER attempted to abolish a national monument, and an attack on one park is an attack on all our parks. Secretary Zinke, I am adamantly opposed to any effort to eliminate or diminish protections for Bears Ears or any other national monument, and I urge you to support our public lands and waters and recommend that our current national monuments remain protected.

INFO - Comment: HHS should reconsider and rescind the mandate requiring coverage of contraception and sterilization in health plans, as these are not "preventive services."  These drugs, devices and procedures prevent not a disease condition, but rather impair the healthy condition known as fertility, and they pose significant risks of their own to women's lives and health.  Indeed, some contraceptives can act after fertilization and therefore raise concerns about harm to new human life.  At a minimum, consistent with the Affordable Care Act and the Weldon amendment, HHS should not mandate coverage of any drug or device that can disrupt an existing pregnancy.  As long as the mandate, or any portion of the mandate, remains in place, however, I fully support the exemptions that these two interim final rules together provide to stakeholders with religious or moral objections, and I commend HHS for adopting these exemptions. Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

Under Option 2, I feel that your price point of $10 is unfair for premium cigars. I purchase many hand rolled premium cigars for less than $10. This is an unfair stipulation in the proposed regulations that would harm not only cigar smokers but manufacturers and retailers as well.  Regarding flavor, I do not believe that premium hand rolled cigars should be included with machine made Swisher Sweet and similar products. It's also unfair to expect cigar retailers to restrict access to cigars in humidors by not allowing customers to view cigars before purchasing.

New annual booster vaccines targeting the most current COVID-19 variants possible give people the best chance of combating any severe health issues associated with COVID-19 infection, if not outright prevent infection altogether. Restricting who can get these critical booster vaccines would put millions at risk of infection, chronic health issues (i.e. Long COVID), hospitalization and death. The 2025-2026 booster vaccines and all future booster vaccines should be made available without any of the proposed eligibility restrictions.

INFO - Comment: I am writing to express my strong support for Medicare's proposal to stop abuses of the 340B drug discount program. <br/><br/>Abuse of the 340B program by some hospitals is causing serious, unintended consequences for the nation's cancer patients and system. It is costing the government and patients much more for cancer care that could - and should - be delivered in local, affordable community oncology clinics.<br/><br/>Everyone agrees that 340B is a critically important safety-net program for uninsured, poor, or vulnerable patients. Unfortunately, the program has grown tremendously to include nearly half of all acute care hospitals in the United States. This is because some hospitals have figured out that they can profit off of 340B discounts without any oversight or accountability.<br/><br/>Without 340B reform, no one wins (except for some hospitals). Putting profits before patients is bad for those who truly need 340B discounts and people like me who rely on quality, affordable, and accessible local cancer care in their own community. This is particularly important for rural and underserved communities where there are few cancer care providers.<br/><br/>340B hospitals should be held to high standards of transparency and accountability, so that government and the public understand exactly how the discounts are being used. As it stands today, hospitals are not required to show how they are using 340B savings or even if they are directly lowering costs for patients. Instead hospitals can pocket the profits for use on executive bonuses, new buildings, and more. In addition to accountability, we need transparency and public reporting from all the 340B program participants.<br/><br/>With this in mind, I want you to know that I stand with Medicare and CMS as it reforms 340B so it works how it was originally intended. Everyone should support this effort to end hospital abuse of the program.<br/>

Communities of color are already disproportionately impacted by environmental challenges and NEPA is one of the strongest tools we have to overcome this environmental racism. As NEPA reviews are often the only way for people to voice their concerns about the consequences federal projects will have on their communities and demonstrate how local expertise can improve them, we need these laws in place to ensure most impacted communities have a voice in the process. Our communities are safer and healthier because of NEPA. <br/><br/>Any attack on NEPA is an attack on our ability to keep our communities safe and healthy.

INFO - Title: TX-Aronoff, Ronald
INFO - Comment: I am a Texas physician who is extremely disappointed and disillusioned with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' draft rule to implement the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA). Physicians  as a profession and individually  are dedicated to constantly improving the quality of care we provide. But as I read it, this rule will wreak havoc with my practice while offering absolutely no evidence that it will do anything to improve patient care. <br/><br/>Here are my recommendations:<br/><br/>Since you won't finalize the rules until on or around Nov. 1, 2016, the Jan. 1, 2017, start date is completely unreasonable. Physicians need at least a six-month deferment to prepare our practices and processes for all the changes MACRA is demanding. Please begin the first period on July 1 and end it on Dec. 31. This deferment will be particularly critical for small practices.<br/><br/>Set the Low-Volume-Threshold high enough to exempt physicians who have no possibility of a positive return on their investment in the cost of reporting. The ongoing cost of reporting, on the quality measures alone, is more than $10,000 per year per physician, and physicians who undertake the reporting efforts can, on average, expect to avoid penalties but not earn incentives, Therefore I urge you to set the Low-Volume-Threshold in 2019 at $250,000 of Medicare revenue. At that amount, the avoided penalties at 4 percent would approximately equal the $10,000 cost of reporting. Below that amount there is no likely return that exceeds the costs of reporting. Below that amount, I urge you to make Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) reporting optional, but exempt from any penalties the physicians who attempt to comply.<br/><br/>Keep it simple. Reduce the proposed program requirements, simplify the scoring of each MIPS category, and establish a more equitable point system among all physicians and other eligible clinicians.<br/><br/>Establish objective and timely measurement and reporting systems that are simpler and less costly than those required under current programs like PQRS and meaningful use. The focus should be improving care for all Medicare patients, not creating yearly physician winners and losers with payment affected two years after care has been delivered.<br/><br/>Use quality metrics that capture those activities that are under the physician's control and have been shown to improve quality of care, enhance access-to-care, and/or reduce the cost of care. The focus should be on metrics that are most meaningful to our practices and our patients, not on what will result in the best "score."<br/><br/>Make feedback reports available during current reporting periods so that we physicians can correct errors and omissions in a timely fashion. Make the reports easy to access and understand, and include a process for physicians to request and implement revisions when data are incorrect.<br/><br/>Require electronic health records vendors to build and maintain products that meet federal specifications. Don't force us to have to vouch for their products. Don't force physicians to purchase and constantly upgrade expensive and often-balky systems.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I am dedicated to the goal of improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of the care I provide to my patients. Your proposed MACRA rule, however, will take medicine in the total opposite direction. Please chart a different course of action. Please take the time necessary to ensure that this new law supports and enhances the physicians who provide the medical care to our nation's 54 million Medicare beneficiaries. Please stop moving down a path that threatens to plow under tens of thousands of physician practices and needlessly create an access crisis for patients covered by Medicare.

INFO - Comment: As a supporter of Defenders of Wildlife and someone who cares about protecting wolves in the Greater Yellowstone region and throughout the Northern Rockies, I strongly urge your agency to scrap your proposal to remove Endangered Species Act protections for these amazing animals.  Rather than repackaging a severely flawed plan that has already been rejected by a federal judge, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service needs to take a fresh look at the management of wolves in the region.  The proposal allows as many as 1,000 wolves to be killed as soon as they lose the protections of the Endangered Species Act  -- slashing the population by as much as two thirds. Such drastic reductions in wolf numbers would be a serious obstacle preventing wolves from establishing a sustainable and connected wolf population in the region.  Furthermore, the current proposal is the product of a flawed process and will likely result in the same types of policy conflicts and legal battles that have plagued wolf management in the past.  I strongly urge you to work with wildlife biologists to revise your plan and collaborate with wildlife conservationists, ranchers, tourism officials, hunters and other interested individuals to develop new science-based state wolf management plans that are more informed, inclusive and balanced.  Thank you for considering my comments.

INFO - Comment: I am submitting a comment in strong support of this proposed rule, RIN #: 1840-AD72. The rule will overturn harmful Trump-era regulations that create a two-tiered system, forcing secular groups to follow all university policies while religious peer groups are given free rein to violate policies so long as they can claim a religious exemption. This opened the door for discrimination, allowing religious groups to exclude minority communities without fear of punishment.<br/><br/>College campuses provide young adults with the ability to explore perspectives different from their own, including empathy and awareness of future community leaders. By allowing religious groups to discriminate against other students, this goes against the very nature of a college campus as well as existing “all-comers” policies, which prohibits student groups from rejecting leaders based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or other protected characteristics. The current rule incorrectly assumes that student groups are rejecting religious students despite these policies, which simply is not the case.<br/><br/>The current rule conflicts with the 2010 Supreme Court case, Christian Legal Society v. Martinez, 561 U.S. 661, which confirmed that exempting religious student groups from an all-comers policy amounted to “preferential, not equal, treatment.” By rescinding this rule, the Department of Postsecondary Education is additionally supporting nonreligious students, the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population by religious identification.<br/><br/>I urge the department to finalize the proposed rule as written, in support of colleges protecting their students and to create a conducive environment for education and inclusivity.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Ms. Evelyn Urquhart

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Cardona,<br/><br/>I write to oppose the proposed Title IX rule that would completely reverse the current protections for women and girls in sports. <br/><br/>This rule’s interpretation of Title IX would prohibit schools from establishing policies for sports based on biological sex. Instead, it would create uncomfortable, even dangerous, situations for student athletes, and would put teachers, staff, and coaches who care about students and the reality of biological sex in the untenable position of violating their beliefs.<br/><br/>The proposal, if adopted, would protect only a claimed “transgender” status, which will allow boys and men to compete on teams once reserved for girls and women. This is a blatant attempt to undermine 50 years of Title IX protections for female athletes, as well as the many states and localities that have passed legislation to protect women’s and girls’ sports. The federal government should not pressure local schools and school districts to ignore biology, safety, and fairness. <br/><br/>The proposed rule would unreasonably prohibit boys-only and girls-only sports teams in elementary schools. I do not believe that the Department of Education is acting in good faith when it claims it will consider the needs of middle, high school, or college aged women and girls by requiring them to make their case and convince you to allow them to retain their sex-based rights under a reimagined Title IX. Women should not have to petition the government to in order to keep their basic rights to safety and fairness. <br/><br/>The abolition of male and female categories will allow males to access private spaces previously reserved for women and girls. Coaches will be forced to supervise opposite sex young athletes in locker rooms, while girls and women will be forced to share showers, changing areas, and possibly beds or bedrooms (when traveling for games) with boys and men based on “gender identity” claims. Physical differences between boys and girls will put girls at higher risk of injury on the playing field.  Just recently, news broke of a female high school volleyball player who suffered long-term injuries last fall when she was spiked in the face by a male player on the opposing team. This young man was allowed to join the girl’s team because he identifies as a transgender female. <br/><br/>Boys and girls, men and women currently have the chance to play on the teams aligned with their biological sex. Protecting women’s and girls’ sports doesn’t “ban” anyone from participating, it simply ensures that women’s sports can recognize biological reality rather than being bullied by individuals with a subjective (and often transitory) sense of “gender identity.” I oppose these changes to Title IX and object to the Biden Administration bullying schools and states by holding federal funds hostage to their transgender agenda.<br/><br/>I ask that you protect the integrity of women’s athletics and Title IX by withdrawing this proposed rule. <br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Beverley Houseworth

INFO - Comment: I am writing to express my concern about the potential loss of access to compounded GLP-1 treatments, which hundreds of thousands of Americans have found to be essential for managing their health.<br/><br/>Due to affordability and availability issues, patients have relied on compounded semaglutide through Hims as an alternative to the brand-name medications from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. If the FDA moves forward with restricting compounded GLP-1s, patients will be faced with the difficult choice of either spending significantly more money on name-brand products or forgoing a treatment that has been life-changing. <br/><br/>Compounded GLP-1s are not just an alternative—they are essential medications for patients who rely on them to manage their health safely and effectively.

INFO - Comment: <br/>Maresa Luzier<br/>Public Lands, BCHNM<br/> <br/>Attention: RIN 1004-AE72<br/> <br/>Dear Secretary Bernhardt,<br/> I am writing to voice my strong opposition to the Bureau of Land Managements (BLMs) proposed Rule to allow motorized bicycles (E-bikes) on non-motorized trails. I am deeply concerned that your proposed rule is unmanageable and would cause significant safety issues on our trails, generate significant user conflict, and open the door to further motorization of Americas backcountry wildlands.  <br/> E-bikes have a place on public lands and are currently allowed on the majority of roads and trails on BLM lands across the West. The BLM already has the tools it needs to designate new or existing trails as open to E-bike use. In fact, the BLM is evaluating new trail proposals right nowin Utah, Colorado, Montana and elsewherethat would authorize E-bike use under existing regulations and policies.<br/> E-bikes by definition have motors. The proposed Rule to classify E-bikes as non-motorized violates common sense, is inconsistent with existing laws and policies and would undermine years of hard work that has gone into planning, funding, and constructing our non-motorized trail networks.<br/> The proposed Rule would direct local BLM land managers to generally allow three classes of E-bikes on non-motorized trails where use by mountain bikes is currently authorized. This includes motorized E-bikes that require no pedaling at allthat is, Class 2 E-bikes that can be powered via a throttle, similar to a motorcycle. The BLM should not generally allow any type of motorized use on non-motorized trails. <br/> Introducing E-bike use in previously non-motorized areas and trails would result in significant safety concerns and increased conflicts between trail users. The BLM must analyze these and other social and physical impacts of the proposed Rule via the National Environmental Policy Act before issuing a Final Rule.<br/> Equestrians seek out non-motorized trails on BLM public lands in order to get away from fast-moving vehicles and enjoy a peaceful, natural environment. We often will choose to avoid trails where there is a potential for encounters with fast-moving bicycles. Most equestrians would find the specter of sharing trails with fast-moving E-bikes unappealing, if not frightening. The result would likely be the loss of these traditional users on non-motorized trails should the BLM authorize shared use by E-bikes. <br/> As equestrians, our selection among trails available in a given area is based, in large part, on safety concerns and the sometimes unpredictable response of our horses or mules in the event of a surprise on-trail encounter. The use of E-bikes, and their potential for travel at relatively high speeds, combined with their often silent approach, elevate the potential for such dangerous encounters.<br/> Higher speeds on trails by one user group puts both user groups at risk. On average, equestrians travel along natural surface trails at speeds that average 5 mph or less. Of the three classes of E-bikes addressed in the proposed Rule, both Class 1 and 2 E-bikes provide motor-assisted speeds up to 20 mph, while Class 3 E-bikes provide the rider with a motor assist up to 28 mph. Capable riders can exceed the maximum motor-assisted speed. The proposed Rule fails to recognize the significant discrepancy in the range of potential speeds by trail users and the resultant safety hazards that are certain to accrue should E-bike use be authorized on non-motorized trails. <br/> The BLM has neither the resources nor the personnel to adequately monitor or enforce E-bike use on its trails. When viewed on the trail, there are few visual differences among the three classifications of E-bikes addressed in the proposed Rule. Thus, restricting the use of one class versus another on a given trail or trails would be pointless and prove frustrating for BLM law enforcement personnel.<br/> Many E-bikes sold on the market today are built with an appearance similar to the three classes of E-bikes addressed in the proposed Rule, yet exceed the maximum power and speed specifications the proposed Rule wishfully envisions. Worse still, a search on YouTube yields dozens of tutorials on how to hack or override the speed constraints programmed into nearly every E-bike from any manufacturer. These facts make irrefutable our claim that the BLM could neither adequately monitor nor enforce E-bike use on non-motorized trails.<br/> I support expanding recreational opportunities on our public lands; E-bikes do indeed have their place. However, this rulemaking is simply the wrong way to go about increasing motorized E-bike opportunities on BLM lands. The BLM should abandon this rulemaking process. Its unnecessary because the agency can already designate trails to allow motorized uses, such as E-bikes.<br/> <br/>Sincerely,<br/> Kathleen Murch

Under current federal regulations, abortion groups like Planned Parenthood are able to receive family planning funds under Title X. This new rule would end that funding. As a pro-life American I strongly believe that abortion groups should not receive taxpayer funds. And Im not alone: 82% of Americans believe there should be restrictions on abortion in some or all cases and 60% of Americans agree: taxpayers should not fund abortion.

INFO - Comment: As a small-business operator in Ohio, I'm very disappointed to learn that the FDA is considering a ban on licensed retailers selling menthol cigarettes to adults 21 and older. Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning menthol cigarettes could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since menthol cigarettes alone make up 36% of all cigarette sales in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of menthol could undermine my ability to operate by significantly impacting my revenue. Plain and simple: it's misguided and could force small businesses to close.<br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, menthol cigarettes could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime under the laws of all 50 states.  Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of menthol cigarettes is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.<br/>

NEPA requires agencies to undertake an assessment of the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to making decisions. This has achieved two major effects: better-informed decision-making as a result of required environmental impact assessments and increased citizen involvement. We teach our children to "look before they leap." NEPA simply and sensibly requires the government to do the same.<br/><br/>In addition to protecting public health and community involvement, NEPA saves taxpayer money by ensuring project efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and safeguards against poorly conceived projects being pushed through. It also promotes government accountability and transparency, and ensures climate change remains an integral part of the federal government's decision-making process. NEPA is a roadmap to smarter decision-making that benefits all Americans.<br/><br/>Please oppose the proposed revisions to NEPA that would reduce scientific analysis and public involvement in decision-making.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>NANCY PEARLMAN<br/><br/>

INFO - Comment: Dear Fish and Wildlife Service,<br/><br/>Thank you for undoing some of the Trump administration’s damage to critical Endangered Species Act regulations. I am heartened by many aspects of your proposed restoration. <br/><br/>However, there are multiple aspects of your proposed rules that are insufficient for the challenges that endangered wildlife are facing.  <br/><br/>First, you must go back to the drawing board and fully restore section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, which governs interagency consultation. For 50 years it's been established that the federal government should not engage in activities that could jeopardize species' survival or destroy habitat they need to survive and recover.  <br/><br/>Specifically, the Biden administration must rescind the addition of “as a whole” to section 402.02. This Trump-era language created an enormous loophole, inconsistent with the intent of the Endangered Species Act itself. The nefarious “as a whole” language is a free pass to destroy critical habitat as long as the total destruction of a species’ entire critical habitat is avoided. This is especially damaging for wide-ranging and migratory species, from piping plover to marbled murrelet, from salmon to lynx. This language also ignores the cumulative impact of different causes of habitat destruction over time. And it goes against the science-based establishment of critical habitat to ensure both the species survival and recovery, instead treating some areas of critical habitat as expendable.   <br/><br/>Additional definition changes from the Trump era that need to be reversed include one that creates unnecessary confusion when examining an agency action that is ongoing, or a continuation of past activities as opposed to something new (“environmental baseline” section 402.02).   <br/><br/>Additionally, you must reverse Trump’s damaging changes in section 424.11(e) that allow plants and animals to be prematurely delisted. It is essential that species recovery meets all science-based standards before removing the backstop of Endangered Species Act protections that have kept so many species alive.  <br/><br/>Each of the many changes to Endangered Species Act regulations made by the Trump administration weakened protections for threatened and endangered species at a time when we must be doing everything in our power to fight the biodiversity crisis and recover species from the brink of extinction. Despite the broad support for restoring and strengthening the rules that implement the Act, you’ve left multiple loopholes from the Trump-era rollbacks in place, which will undoubtedly jeopardize future efforts to protect wildlife and habitat. By failing to fully restore the Endangered Species Act rules, you've left a significant job less than half done. Now is the time to get this right; we have no more time to waste.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Pam Fleming<br/>237 Waverly Ave  Brooklyn, NY 11205-3607

INFO - Comment: To Whom it May Concern,<br/><br/>Today I write in strong support of the proposed rule titled: Compliance With Statutory Program Integrity Requirements (HHS-OS-2018-0008), also known as the Protect Life Rule.<br/><br/>The proposed rule seeks to reinstate Reagan-era prohibitions on Title X funding for abortion centers. Similar regulations were upheld by the Supreme Court in 1991 in Rust v. Sullivan (500 U.S. 173).<br/><br/>Abortion is not family planning. This rule would draw a bright line between abortion and family planning, as was clearly intended in the statute.<br/><br/>Currently 266 Planned Parenthood abortion centers are also federal Title X locations. Planned Parenthood is the nations largest abortion business and receives $50-$60 million a year from Title X. They should not be entitled to treat Title X as their personal slush fund. Research released by the Charlotte Lozier Institute in 2018 shows Planned Parenthood has inflated the U.S. abortion rate, controlling more than 35% of the abortion industry and resulting in more than three million extra abortions that could have been avoided.<br/><br/>American taxpayers do not want to be complicit in abortions through their taxpayer dollars. According to a January 2018 Marist poll, six in ten Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion. Money is fungible and tax dollars should be invested in comprehensive health care alternatives, not used as a slush fund to prop up the abortion industry.<br/><br/>It's important to note that the proposed rule will not reduce family planning funding by a single dollar. This rule would simply direct taxpayer funds to family planning providers who stay out of the abortion business. Women and girls are best served at alternative health care centers including community and rural health care centers that outnumber Planned Parenthood abortion facilities by more than 20 to 1 nationwide.<br/><br/>I strongly urge adoption of the rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Frances Harry<br/>Ohio

Building on the historic progress of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, this rule proposes limiting added sugars in school meals for the very first time. School meals that are limited in added sugars and sodium and contain whole grains can help introduce healthy eating habits and can help mitigate chronic health conditions.<br/><br/>Added Sugars: School breakfasts are far too sugary, and I applaud the USDA’s proposed cap of no more than 10 percent of calories from added sugars, which mirrors the Dietary Guidelines recommendation. I also support USDA’s product-specific added sugars limits.  <br/><br/>Sodium: While these sodium reduction goals represent progress, the final limits do not go far enough and are out of alignment with the Dietary Guidelines’ quantitative recommendations. For instance, children up to age 8 will get 83 percent of their daily recommended sodium limit from breakfast and lunch combined, leaving just 17 percent leftover for snacks and dinner. A 13-year-old will get 77 percent of their daily limit from school breakfast and lunch, and high school students will get 63 percent.<br/><br/>Whole Grains: The two options proposed by the USDA require less than half of grains offered be whole, which is not aligned with the Dietary Guidelines’ recommendations. I encourage the USDA to strengthen the whole grain-rich requirement.<br/><br/>Healthy, wholesome meals provide children the nutrients they need to grow, develop and learn in and out of the classroom, and the 30 million kids who rely on school meals every day deserve better.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Cardona,<br/><br/>I write to comment on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by the U.S. Department of Education to rescind regulations related to religious student organizations at certain public institutions of higher education, known as the “Free Inquiry Rule.” The changes proposed by this administration would remove protections put in place to prevent institutions of higher education (IHE) that receive federal grants from discriminating against any religious student organization based on the religious student organization’s beliefs. The changes proposed by this administration fails to reinforce First Amendment protections and would leave religious student groups more vulnerable to discrimination.<br/><br/>The “Free Inquiry Rule” is a common-sense protection that reinforces First Amendment rights. The Department of Education should rightly reinforce these constitutional rights. The fact that the Department is seeking to rollback these protections is gravely concerning. <br/><br/>With free speech and religious freedom under attack on college campuses across America, we need the protections provided by the “Free Inquiry Rule” now more than ever. Religious student groups on university campuses, including religious minorities, too often face the risk of being shut down or “canceled” by fellow students or school officials for expressing sincerely-held beliefs perceived to be controversial. <br/><br/>The administrators of institutions of higher education must be given clear guidance from the Department of Education that discrimination against religious student groups may not be tolerated. The Biden administration must protect students’ rights to free speech and free exercise of religion.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I hope you will reconsider implementation of this rule.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Miss Aimee Keyes<br/>29497 205th Ave, Columbus, NE 68601-8878

INFO - Comment: The notice-and-takedown process under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is heavily biased in favor of corporate copyright holders and too commonly used to censor content that is protected under fair use. This system has had dire effects on political expression, creativity, and commercial innovation on the Internet. The DMCA needs new safeguards to protect against abuse and companies that infringe on users' free speech need to be held responsible.<br/><br/>Under a court sanction (Lenz v. Universal Music) companies are able to use computer algorithms to scan content posted to the Internet for possible copyright violations and issue automated takedowns. This process is vulnerable to significant error and does not allow for judgements to be made about possible fair use exceptions, therefore resulting in the censorship of vast amounts of legitimate (i.e. legal) speech and creative expression on the Internet.<br/><br/>According to a recent study from Berkeley and Columbia law professors, nearly 30 percent of takedown notices are of questionable validity and would benefit from human review.<br/><br/>While the DMCA's safe harbor provisions are important for making an open, participatory Internet possible, the notice-and-takedown procedures that have been developed alongside them have disproportionately benefited corporate copyright holders and copyright trolls who seek to shut down legitimate competition and extract money from innocent victims.<br/><br/>The notice-and-takedown process puts the most important types of content at risk. Political speech can be censored at crucial moments in a campaign. Videos can be taken offline at moments when they are crucial for the survival of small businesses. This kind of damage can not be undone.<br/><br/>To balance the process, copyright holders need to have more responsibility for considering fair use when enforcing copyright laws. As sites like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter have become important public spaces, companies that issue takedown notices of content that is clearly protected by fair use should be held liable for violating individuals' rights to free speech.<br/><br/>Balance is desperately needed in the notice and takedown system. One step to creating that balance is to  impose statutory damages for companies that abuse the DMCA takedown process or fail to adhere to any fair use review. In particular, automated takedowns must be discouraged as they inhibit free speech and fair use of copyrighted works.

INFO - Comment: Dear Odin Stephens, Georgia Director Wildlife Services,<br/><br/>Thank you for providing the opportunity to comment on this important matter regarding birds of various species in Georgia. As someone who has a particular interest in the wellbeing of birds in Georgia and one of In Defense of Animals’ over 250,000 supporters, I urge you to more thoroughly assess the impacts of lethal bird management with an EIS and to move forward with Alternative 3, non-lethal management of birds.<br/><br/>The proposed alternatives that involve lethal management methods could significantly interfere with the human enjoyment of recreational activities and the natural environment. Birds are an important part of the public trust and as your report states, simply the knowledge that wild animals exist is meaningful to many people. In addition to this, birds have an inherent right to exist. <br/><br/>More in-depth research is needed before proceeding with an alternative that includes lethal management. Wildlife Services should prepare an EIS to more thoroughly investigate the negative impacts on bird populations and the environment lethal management could cause. It is also important that the agency has an accurate assessment of current bird populations. For example, the EA report states that the current wild turkey population in Georgia is unknown. <br/><br/>Additionally, ingesting poisons and avicides like Avitrol and DRC-1339 are not only a horrible way for birds to die, but they pose a risk to other wild animals, animal companions, and humans as well. Poisons can move through the food chain and affect raptors and other predators and scavengers who may eat birds exposed to these toxins. Children and animal companions can also accidentally ingest or come into contact with these poisons. The use of these lethal methods should not be a part of any alternative under consideration. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Wildlife Services should proceed with Alternative 3 and not use any non-lethal methods and additionally, an EIS should be conducted before any non-lethal methods are considered. An alternative where all non-lethal methods are exhausted first before lethal means are used should be considered as its own Alternative option separate from Alternative 1. More resources should go into reproductive inhibitors and the development of educational programs that highlight the need for humans to coexist with bird species. <br/><br/>There are a plethora of alternative non-lethal methods that are available and effective. These include human presence, exclusion methods like netting and fencing, noise and visual deterrents, habitat alteration, and relocation, among others. Wildlife Services is considering ‘Alternative 3’ which would allow only the use of non-lethal bird management methods, and it is imperative that the agency gives this option the fair consideration it warrants for the wellbeing of birds, humans, and other wild animals.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms. Nancy Hulme

This Summer's wildfires, extreme heat waves, and hurricanes only reaffirms what our communities already know: The most severe effects of the climate crisis are disproportionately felt by the Latine community, especially those that are low-income. Latines are more likely to be put in danger, disenfranchised, ill, and even die from climate-exacerbated natural disasters and other environmental harms.<br/><br/>As we begin to phase out fossil fuels and federal clean energy investments begin to flow, we must ensure this new infrastructure is built out in a just and equitable manner. NEPA has been an effective tool for our communities to prevent polluting projects from impacting the health and environment of our neighborhoods and I look forward to the following improvements to be finalized no later than Spring 2024.<br/><br/>The final NEPA regulations must:<br/><br/>1. Require agencies to consider project alternatives that would decrease impacts on air, water, and land while also looking at cumulative impacts' communities face from exposure to numerous pollutants.<br/><br/>2. Reaffirm NEPA as a tool for environmental justice that gives communities the ability to have meaningful input in the project development process while helping avoid disproportionate impacts on frontline communities.<br/><br/>3. Require translation and interpretation at every step of the public input process including announcement of public notices in English as well as any required alternative languages in all available venues. This includes email announcements, physical public notices posted in community points of interests, websites, social media, and other forms of media.<br/><br/>4. Require agencies to include future climate impacts when considering new projects. Analyzing these risks will result in safer, more resilient infrastructure for communities.<br/><br/>5. Mandate more transparency in the project development process by requiring a timely release of documents and a minimum 30-day comment period for community review.<br/><br/>6. Enshrine tribal consultation and respect for tribal sovereignty throughout the project development process.<br/><br/>7. Ensure a strong NEPA process that addresses the need to build out the clean energy transition in close consultation with communities most impacted by energy development.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking these comments into consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>ms Sally Klossner<br/>IL

Please help establish regulations for the following:  <br/><br/>Require a large enough space for birds to be able to fly, which is the most natural and fundamental behavior of almost all bird species.<br/>Prohibit licensees from mutilating birds, including pinioning, which is completely unnecessary and cruel.<br/>Prohibit public contact with birds, including riding birds such as ostriches, which causes stress and puts them at risk of injury.<br/>Prohibit the tethering of birds, which severely limits their mobility and doesn’t allow them to express normal, natural behavior.<br/>Wild and exotic animals, including parrots and most other bird species, should never be kept or sold as pets. At the very least, the agency should include definitions of “pet animal” and “retail pet store” that explicitly provide all wild and exotic bird species with protection.<br/>Thank you for taking action to help captive birds!

This will improve working conditions and the quality of care for nursing home residents. It also will hold nursing home owners accountable for putting cost cutting and profits above patients and workers.<br/><br/>We all deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. This is especially true for people who need nursing home care and those who do the important, challenging work of caring for them. The proposed rule is a good start.<br/><br/>I agree with requiring a registered nurse to always be on site. I also agree with setting staffing requirements for nurse aides and registered nurses. These are common-sense requirements.<br/><br/>You should also make the rule stronger. To do this, you should:<br/><br/>Require nursing homes to have a minimum number of licensed practical nurses or licensed vocational nurses (LPNs/LVNs). These health care professionals also provide valuable care in nursing homes.<br/><br/>Increase the minimum staffing requirement above what you have proposed. Taking good care of nursing home residents requires more staff to provide the basic support they need and deserve.<br/><br/>Make sure these requirements are enforced.

By reversing the most recent five-year plan by the Obama administration, the president is carelessly bowing to corporate polluters and forsaking the millions of Americans that will be harmed by this decision. <br/> <br/>The mission of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is to provide stewardship of our oceans natural resources with consideration of the environmental and economic impacts of development in the Outer Continental Shelf. I believe that exposing our coastal communities to hazardous oil and gas drilling directly runs counter to the BOEMs mission and defies your duty to the American people. <br/> <br/>Opening up these fragile ecosystems to drilling jeopardizes our coastal economies, marine wildlife, and climate. Local economies reliant on tourism or fishing could face lasting impacts of devastating spills. It is a risk not worth taking. <br/> <br/>Our oceans should be protected, not polluted.

These proposed H-2A regulatory changes are a critical step towards addressing the long-standing issues of abuse, exploitation, and trafficking of farm workers in the H-2A program. In particular, the Department of Homeland Security changes would make it easier for H-2A workers to leave an abusive employer in search of a better employment opportunity, enhancing enforcement against retaliation, and protecting visa status for those who apply to become a permanent resident. By improving the H-2A program, we are not only protecting the rights and well-being of guest workers but also enhancing the conditions for domestic farm workers. <br/><br/>I urge the Department of Homeland Security to finalize these proposed rules.

I am a concerned parent who does not want the protections enacted by the Obama Administration to be rolled back.<br/><br/>In particular I am concerned that Secretary DeVos came to the conclusion that there are problems with the current state of Title IX's application in schools and colleges, including considering that current regulations are: overly broad definitions of sexual harassment, lack of notice to the parties, lack of consistency regarding both parties' right to know the evidence relied on by the school investigator and right to cross-examine parties and witnesses. She doesn't seem to be as concerned for the victims, as she is fpr those who are accused of the crime.<br/><br/>If enacted this rule would lose the protections for young women and men who are often not believed , and not protected after they are assaulted on/off campus.<br/><br/>The related research and data summarized below show that the regulation will harm students and student survivors. Such as: 1 in every 5 women will be sexually assaulted in college, 34.1% of students who have experienced sexual assault dropout of college, higher than the overall dropout rate for college students, Survivors often dont report their sexual assaults because of fear of being disbelieved or their assault not taken seriously (Holland & Cortina, 2017). Only 2%-10% of reported cases of sexual assault are false. <br/><br/>For the foregoing reasons, these sections of the rule should be struck.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Teresa Harrington<br/>Mother

INFO - Comment: Dear Bureau of Land Management,<br/><br/>I am opposed to oil and gas development in the Western Arctic.  Such development would be incompatible with meeting urgently needed commitments to address the climate crisis.  To demonstrate climate leadership and meet our commitments, the nation needs to move rapidly away from burning fossil fuels. There is no room for expansion, particularly in the Arctic, where oil would not come to market for years. The huge infrastructure build-out required would lock us into reliance on fossil fuels, while bringing further stress to a region feeling climate effects even more acutely than lower latitudes.  I urge the administration to take measures to bring its management of the Western Arctic in line with its commitment to address the climate crisis.   <br/><br/>The proposed regulations are a step in the right direction but do not go far enough.  They offer important incremental protections for some of the Western Arctic’s most ecologically and culturally important areas, such as Teshekpuk Lake, an internationally vital wetland critical for birds from around the globe and for caribou herds that are integral to Alaska Native communities in the region.  However, they do not do enough to address the most imminent threat to the region and the planet—the over two million acres of existing oil leases in the Western Arctic that this administration inherited.  Development on these existing leases—like Willow—threatens the sensitive habitat of the Western Arctic and the nation’s ability to meet its climate goals.   <br/><br/>The current environmental analysis of the Western Arctic, written in the previous administration, fails to study the impact oil development in the region would have on the climate and the nation’s ability to rapidly reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to meet climate goals.  We urge the administration to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the climate impacts of Western Arctic oil development, and to bring its management of the region in line with climate policy by expanding its proposed regulations to require limits on drilling on the millions of acres already leased to oil companies to protect the climate and the fragile resources of the region already under severe strain from climate change.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Trae Israel<br/>1800 Watrous Ave  Des Moines, IA 50315-3265

INFO - Comment: Dear Sec. Haaland,<br/><br/>I urge you to drop the proposed new land exchange agreement that would allow a road to be constructed through the internationally-renowned Izembek Wilderness and National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. <br/><br/>A road cutting through the heart of this irreplaceable Wilderness would be catastrophic—Izembek is a migratory stopover for hundreds of thousands of birds and home to native wildlife such as brown bears, caribou, sea otters, and Stellar sea lions. Izembek deserves to be protected for all time; a road bisecting this special place would not only irreparably harm this Wilderness, but it would invite further, unending ORV trespass and associated damage into what is now a remote and protected place.<br/> <br/>Non-road alternatives for transportation between King Cove and Cold Bay are more reliable, less expensive, and won’t harm Izembek. A 2015 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers analysis that looked at three non-road alternatives—a 150-foot year-round ferry capable of moving through 12-inch-thick ice, a fixed-wing aircraft and new airport, and a helicopter/heliport—deemed a marine option most reliable. Not only would a ferry be dependable more than 99 percent of the time, it is no more cost-prohibitive than building and maintaining a road. Alternatively, upgrading existing medical facilities in King Cove is another more feasible option for dealing with emergency medical situations. <br/><br/>ANILCA does not allow for land exchanges to build roads. The unlawful pretense of first trading away land, then claiming the land is no longer federal, puts at risk every conservation system unit in Alaska. The idea that any Secretary of Interior can give away lands in any Wilderness, National Park, or National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska is a remarkable distortion of the purposes of ANILCA—which are clearly defined as conservation and subsistence—and sets a terrible precedent.<br/><br/>Our nation’s most prized wildlands must not be left to the whims of any future Secretary of Interior who might want to see these lands developed and desecrated. The land exchange must be rejected. A transportation option that doesn’t harm Izembek and its wildlife should instead be utilized.<br/><br/>Thank you.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Becerra,<br/><br/>I write to comment on the proposed rule addressing Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The changes proposed by this administration would further and in some cases, require, the taking of innocent human life, make diagnosing and treating certain patients more difficult, and threaten the conscience rights of healthcare providers.<br/><br/>Expanding the definition of “discrimination on the basis of sex” in section 1557 of the ACA to include “the termination of pregnancy” could have tragic repercussions on health care professionals if it were ever implemented. With this change, the regulations could be read to require doctors and health insurers to perform or cover abortions. If interpreted in this way, the availability of federal financial assistance could be conditional on acts that devalue the sanctity of human life. HHS does not have a compelling interest in requiring the provision and coverage of abortion, especially when Congress has repeatedly protected decisions not to engage with abortion.  <br/><br/>The right to exclude abortion coverage from health plans, and the right of health care providers not to provide or refer for abortion are protected under federal law. Section 1303 of the ACA as well as the Church, Coats-Snow, Weldon, Hyde, and Helms amendments protect the conscience of health care providers. Further enforcement of these existing conscience provisions as well as a plain interpretation of discrimination “on the basis of sex” (as opposed to the flawed definition proposed by this change) are vital to clearing up any confusion over whether section 1557 can be interpreted to require the performance or coverage of abortion.<br/><br/>In addition, this administration’s move to reject basic human biology and its role in providing proper medical care by including “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” in the definition of “discrimination on the basis of sex” would force individuals in the medical field to violate their consciences and even their best medical judgment. It will lead to harming the very patients it purports to help. <br/><br/>This change would make it harder for doctors to properly diagnose and treat patients who identify themselves as transgender. It is widely known that disease sometimes presents differently in men and women and that men and women sometimes need different medications for the same condition. Mandating that doctors ascribe to an unscientific view of gender would not only trample on the conscience rights of those in the medical profession, but it would harm the patients themselves. It could hinder doctors from being able to promptly and accurately diagnose a patient’s condition and provide the necessary treatment. We have already begun to see hindrances in swift patient care due to this unscientific ideology. For example:<br/><br/>-A biological woman identifying as a man and who was listed as a man on medical records was assessed for kidney disease as a man, causing treatment missteps and nearly resulting in death.<br/>-A biological female identifying as a man appeared to be a masculine, overweight man to hospital staff. Therefore, they had no reason to think the patient was pregnant and in labor. Sadly, the patient did not receive immediate care and delivered a stillborn baby. The doctor noted that the male classification “threw us off” from the patient’s actual medical needs.<br/><br/>The definitional changes proposed by this administration could also be interpreted to require that doctors provide or refer patients for gender transition procedures (including puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries) against their conscience and professional medical judgment. It could also be interpreted as requiring health insurance providers to provide coverage for such procedures. These procedures carry significant health risks to patients and have not been shown to reduce suicidal ideation or otherwise improve patients' mental health in the long run. Doctors should not be forced to provide or refer patients for any procedure that goes against their conscience and that they believe will do the patient harm, especially procedures that pose significant risks to a patient’s health and have not been shown to improve patient outcomes.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I sincerely hope that you will rethink these proposed changes to section 1557 of the ACA.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Judith Strother<br/>1202 Woodbrook Ct, Reston, VA 20194<br/>

Title X is a critical, lifesaving program that provides access to cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, birth control, well-woman visits, and more. This is essential care. It's not optional.

For many others, Planned Parenthood health centers may be their only option for basic care. We can't let political agendas cut these women off from the care they need, and we can't let politicians ignore the laws that protect people's health care access. All people should be able to visit the health care providers they trust without interference from lawmakers.

The proposed listing will not solve the problem, but will devastate the recreational enjoyment of our public lands, as well as the economic prosperity of the families, communities, and counties that actually live on, work on, and care for these lands.<br/><br/>Real solutions are already being explored by scientific and state actions, and do not require federal intervention. Furthermore, the federal government has not established it has jurisdiction over the proposed designated habitat, which belong to the People of the State of California, and I therefore challenge the federal government's jurisdiction in this matter. Jurisdiction once challenged cannot be assumed, it must be proven.<br/><br/>NO THANKS to the USFWS for entering into secret settlement agreements with the Center For Biological Diversity and pursing a course of action that is so destructive to all concerned, including the frogs and toads.

I strongly agree with the decision Congress made in 1960 that cancer-causing color additives have no place in our foods, drugs, supplements, or cosmetics. I am appalled that FDA has known for more than 30 years that Red 3 can cause cancer and yet still approves the dye to be used in foods, drugs, and supplements. <br/><br/>In 1990, FDA concluded that Red 3 causes cancer when ingested by animals after reviewing studies it received in the early 1980s. From this conclusion, FDA revoked the provisionally allowed uses for Red 3, which at the time included use in cosmetics and externally applied drugs, claiming it would separately take steps to revoke the permanently approved uses, namely drugs and foods, including supplements. Three decades have elapsed, and yet Red 3 remains approved for use in foods, drugs, and supplements and is, in fact, still widely used. FDA estimated in 2016 that 84 percent of the U.S. population two years of age and older is exposed to Red 3. Red 3 is found in thousands of food and drug products currently on the market, including many marketed to children.  <br/><br/>A full ban on Red 3 is long past due. I ask that FDA act quickly and decisively to prohibit all uses of Red 3 to protect consumers, especially children, from this cancer-causing chemical.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Barbara Stanley<br/>Santa Barbara, CA

INFO - Comment: As a clinician, I urge CMS to finalize the final 2024 Physician Fee Schedule with improving access to behavioral health services as a top priority. This proposal has the clear potential to help remedy longstanding disparities in access to these services. <br/><br/>Facilitating Access to the Complete Spectrum of Behavioral Health Services<br/>I applaud CMS proposal to increase the work values for the psychotherapy codes, but I implore CMS to also increase these values for the psychological and neuropsychological testing services, as well as the Health Behavior Assessment & Intervention services. These services are systematically undervalued and warrant increases.  The reimbursement discrepancy will negatively impact patient access to these critical services.<br/><br/>Utilizing Community Health Workers and Assessing Social Determinants of Health<br/>While I appreciate CMS proposals for services addressing health-related social needs, the current proposals for Community Health Integration (CHI) services and Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Risk Assessment both fall short by requiring an Evaluation/Management service furnished by a medical professional.  I urge CMS to revise these proposals to be inclusive of a psychiatric diagnostic evaluation or a health behavioral assessment furnished by a psychologist to serve as the initiating service.<br/><br/>Maintaining Progress in Telehealth Access<br/>Telehealth is a critical vehicle for achieving health equity for patients in communities that have long struggled to access behavioral health treatment. I appreciate CMS recognition that reverting to a lower rate for telehealth services to patients in their homes will lead practitioners to offer telehealth less frequently and I support the proposed rule preserving current reimbursement rates for telehealth services.<br/><br/>Ensuring Access to Science-Based Behavior Management<br/>I support the proposals to activate reimbursement for caregiver behavior management training services. There is extensive empirical support for caregiver behavior management training, and it is the gold standard treatment approach for several health behavior issues. <br/><br/>Facilitating a Population Health Approach to Crisis Treatment<br/>I also support the proposal to create new codes for psychotherapy crisis services furnished outside a traditional setting. A population health approach treats the health of communities and often demands provision of services in non-traditional settings. Those in a crisis should feel free to access services wherever they are in need, and I commend CMS for enabling this flexibility through the proposed rule. <br/><br/>Ensuring Robust Access to Substance Use Disorder Treatment<br/>I support the increased reimbursement for psychotherapy services in the substance use services bundle. Despite some progress over the past several years, the substance use disorder crisis continues to devastate many communities, and this measure will help ensure continued access to common forms of substance use treatment.<br/><br/>Utilizing Technology to Improve Behavioral Health Access<br/>I thank CMS for including requests for information on digital cognitive behavioral therapy.  I recommend that CMS adopt APA Services proposal for a coding structure on evidence-based digital cognitive behavior therapy that recognizes the cost of the device, patient set-up and education, and management of the service furnished through the device as coequal components of successful treatment via these devices.<br/><br/>Accurately Measuring Costs of Providing Treatment<br/>I appreciate that CMS acknowledges practice expense (PE) methodology irregularities that negatively affect reimbursement for behavioral health services.  APA Services developed recommendations for adjustments to improve PE valuation.  l urge CMS to work with APA Services to implement these recommendations to improve PE valuation and reimbursement for behavioral health services.  <br/><br/>Encouraging New Approaches to Suicide Prevention<br/>I was encouraged by CMS request for comments on additional coding and payment for evidence-based interventions for patients at risk of suicide.  There is a need for additional codes, and I urge CMS to work with APA Services to develop new codes for brief interventions and safety planning for patients at risk of suicide.

INFO - Comment: Nancy Potok,<br/><br/>We can’t redefine poverty to make it go away. The Trump Administration’s attempt to shrink the poverty line by changing how it is adjusted for inflation is cruel and irresponsible. Changing the poverty line would mean millions of people could be denied help with essential medical treatment, prescription drugs, food, and home heating or cooling assistance, or see reductions in that help. Low-income people see their costs go up more than most people, so shrinking the poverty line will simply define them as nonpoor and deny them the help they badly need. The Trump Administration should make a good-faith effort to find accurate measures of poverty and to understand the impact of the changes they propose on children, working people, retirees, women, people with disabilities, and communities of color instead of trying to redefine poverty out of existence. <br/><br/>Lori Broger-Mackey <br/>loribromac@gmail.com <br/>10114 Lasaine Ave <br/>Northridge, California 91325<br/><br/> <br/>

This medicine helps patients with a wide variety of ailments, including liver disease, cancer, stroke, and autism.<br/><br/>A glutathione ban would be a disaster. It has many medical applications and there is no commercially available glutathione drug, so a ban would mean no more glutathione IVs. Glutathione is used widely for a variety of conditions because of its role in reducing oxidative stress-an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body.<br/><br/>The FDA cites safety issues with glutathione, including hepatotoxicity. But n-acetylcysteine (NAC), which tells the body to make glutathione, is the standard treatment for acetaminophen poisoning-which causes liver injury. There are also dozens of common drugs (antibiotics, NSAIDs, etc) that cause liver damage; the FDA even has a database of ranking over 1,000 drugs for their ability to damage the liver. These drugs are safe for patients, but glutathione isn't? This doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Please protect access to this critical medicine.

INFO - Comment: As someone who objects to my tax dollars subsidizing the abortion industry, I express support for the proposed rule issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on June 1, 2018 to separate abortion practices from the Title X family planning program. This rule is necessary to ensure that taxpayer dollars are no longer entangled in the abortion industry. The President Clinton regulations allowed the Title X family planning program to become a slush fund for abortion organizations. Pro-life organizations have been shut out of the program because they are unwilling to violate their conscience by applying for funds for a program that requires them to referral for abortion. The Clinton regulations must be changed, and I support the regulation removing the abortion referral requirement and replacing it with a restriction on abortion referrals.<br/><br/>Abortion is not family planning. When Congress first authorized the Title X program, and it made clear that abortion should be separate from the family planning program. Title X funds should be completely physically and financially separate from all abortion-related activities, and Title X recipients should no longer be forced to provide abortion referrals or risk defunding.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule requirement that Title X clinics abide by state reporting laws for rape and abuse in order to put a stop to the exploiting of young women and girls, many of whom are brought to Title X clinics for contraception and abortion by their abusers. The proposed rule would ensure that these girls will be protected and their abusers brought to justice.<br/><br/>The majority of American voters do not want their money entwined with the abortion industry. I support this proposed rule that will finally disentangle Title X money from the abortion industry.

Blending ethanol at levels higher than 10% has been proven to harm many conventional engines. This could damage farm equipment and other commercial vehicles not to mention what it can do the many personal vehicles. Furthermore these ethanol fuel levels are meant to promote fuels such as E85 for which there is negligible demand.<br/><br/>The existing standard has already had the unintended consequence of raising the cost to agricultural businesses which rely on corn for feed, and I am concerned that the proposed standards may only continue to raise costs. <br/><br/>The Renewable Fuel Standard has been based on a number of flawed assumptions. At this point I believe the best course of action is for Congress to fix RFS legislatively. In the short term I ask that the EPA lower the ethanol blending requirements and to set the final ethanol level below 10 percent.<br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/> <br/>Colin Hastings<br/>Executive Director<br/>Pasco Chamber of Commerce

To prevent that, they need to face stiffer financial penalties, and should not be able to provide estimates or gather patient data in the process. <br/><br/>I respectfully recommend that CMS increase the daily penalty to far more than $10 a bed to at least $300 per day per patient bed, with no cap. The proposed rule should also not consider what sort of estimate would be acceptable, but rather forbid hospitals from providing estimates, which are nonbinding. Patients want and need actual, guaranteed prices so they can avoid being devastated by unexpected healthcare bills.<br/><br/>CMS has written an excellent rule, one that promises to dramatically lower healthcare costs and introduce competition. Now we need to hold hospitals, and eventually insurance companies and all the middle players, fully accountable.

INFO - Comment: 1.  BUMP STOCKS DO NOT FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF MACHINE GUN UNDER THE NFA.<br/><br/>The Obama administration was correct when, in 2010, it determined that bump stocks did not convert semi-autos into fully automatic firearms.<br/><br/>Federal law says, in part, that a machine gun is a weapon that can fire automatically more than one shot ... by a single function of the trigger. The definition includes ...any part designed and intended solely and exclusively ... for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun... (26 U.S.C. 5845(b)) <br/><br/>According to this definition, a bump stock does not fall within this definition.<br/><br/>With a bump stock, each and every round is discharged as the result of an independent pull of the trigger.  So it is simply untrue that the bump stock assists the discharge of more than one round by a single function of the trigger -- no matter how fast the gun discharges rounds.  <br/><br/>One pull, one discharge.  This is the classic textbook definition of a SEMI-automatic firearm.<br/><br/>If the ATF were to illegitimately use a standard based on increasing the rate of fire to ban or regulate bump stocks, then what is to stop it from illegitimately holding that other rate-increasing devices -- like belt loops, sticks or fingers -- are machineguns as well?  YouTube abounds with examples of people using these items to increase the rate of fire of their semi-autos. <br/><br/> <br/>2. ATF HAS NO CONSTITUTIONAL OR LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BAN OR REGULATE BUMP STOCKS.<br/><br/>The ATF's statutory authority, contained at 6 U.S.C. 531, is very narrow.  Nowhere does federal law give ATF the general authority to regulate the safety of firearms, accessories, or parts.  This is important, because, if federal law did do this, then it could administratively ban semi-automatics, or handguns, or all guns. <br/><br/>Constitutionally, the Second Amendment says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Our rights are not privileges from the government that can be revoked or regulated at will. And regulating or banning bump stocks would serve as unconstitutional infringements.

The goal of the Census is to count ALL individuals living in the United States, regardless of immigration status. The census is a tool for the U.S. government to obtain a snap shot of our nations demographics and one that is critical to the apportionment of seats in Congress. The addition of a citizenship question is harmful to the overall accuracy and integrity of the Census and I object to its inclusion in the 2020 Census. <br/> <br/>Locally, [PERSONALIZE YOUR COMMENT TO HELP LOCALIZE THE MESSAGE]<br/><br/>Nationally, 16.7 million people live in mixed immigration status households. The members of these families are very much a part of our country and communities and adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census threatens to erase their presence in our country. In the early years of the Census, questions about whether to include representation of African Americans and American Indians surfaced.  While eventually both populations were fully included in the count, these are reminders of the fight for representation of communities of color in the United States and a history we cannot repeat. The inclusion of the citizenship question would do exactly that. <br/> <br/>Additionally, including a question that would make it more difficult to capture our communities accurately will lead to an increase in the cost in the Census. This would mean more taxpayer money to complete a Census count that will likely not be the most accurate. An inaccurate count could mean the loss of local funding that supports important programs and infrastructure projects in our communities.  <br/><br/>The Census should stay committed to the goal of counting every person who resides in the United States, regardless of status.

INFO - Comment: Dear Mr. Rauch, and Mr. Barnette,<br/><br/>I am writing today to support the National Marine Fisheries Services advance notice of proposed rulemaking, which proposes to expand the requirement to use Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) on vessels less than 40 feet in the southeast U.S. shrimp fisheries and requests public input on impacts. The Fisheries Service should expand the TEDs rule to require 3-inch bar spacing TEDs on all trawls in the shrimp fisheries of the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.<br/><br/>All six sea turtle species found in U.S. waters are listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Sea turtles face significant threats from commercial fishing. Sea turtles, which require air to breathe, can get caught in fishing nets as bycatch, non-target catch, and be harmed or even drowned. According to the Fisheries Services own estimates, under the rules currently in place, Southeast U.S. shrimp trawl nets come into contact with endangered or threatened sea turtles over half-a-million times a year, resulting in as many as 50,000 sea turtles deaths. If used properly, TEDs provide an escape hatch in the fishing nets that can reduce sea turtle bycatch by as much as 97 percent. And, narrower, 3-inch bar spacing TEDs protect small, juvenile sea turtles. At least 50 percent more sea turtles could be saved with the expansion of the TEDs rule to all shrimp trawling vessels in the Southeast.<br/><br/>In addition to saving sea turtles, TEDs have been proven to reduce bycatch of other marine life, including recreationally and commercially valuable fish. Moreover, expanding use of TEDs is beneficial to shrimp fishers, who will likely spend less time sorting out the targeted shrimp from non-target species, may have reduced fuel costs due to reduction of drag, and will likely benefit from broader markets if the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch removes the red-listing for the fishery.<br/>With more sea turtles alive and well due to expanded TEDs use, locals and tourists in the Southeast region can observe sea turtles on land  through guided nesting walks and rehabilitation release events  as well as in the water through scuba diving. Coastal economies in the Southeast benefit from sea turtle tourism, which attracts over 500,000 visitors annually.<br/><br/>Expanding 3-inch bar spacing TEDs to all trawls in the U.S. southeast shrimp fishery not only provides necessary protections for endangered and threatened sea turtles, as required by the Endangered Species Act, but also benefits fishers, coastal communities, and visitors to the Southeast region. I urge you to fully and effectively implement this common-sense, win-win solution: expand the TEDs rule to require 3-inch bar spacing TEDs on all trawls in the shrimp fisheries of the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Josh Pederson

INFO - Comment: Dear Dockets Management Staff: <br/> <br/>I urge you to finalize an evidence-based front-of-package nutrition labeling (FOPNL) rule that will help consumers make healthier choices for themselves and their families. There is a clear need for FOPNL in the U.S. to address high rates of chronic disease. U.S. adults consume 50 percent more sodium, 40 percent more added sugars, and 30 percent more saturated fat per day than the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend, contributing to preventable chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The U.S. packaged food supply is far too high in these harmful nutrients.  <br/><br/>I strongly support the FDA’s proposal for the U.S. to adopt a mandatory, interpretive FOPNL system that highlights products’ levels of key nutrients to limit—saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars. FOPNL should be mandatory to ensure that all food companies disclose key nutrient information to consumers, not just those who could benefit from disclosure (because their products are already healthy). FOPNL should also be interpretive, helping consumers understand when products’ levels of added sugars, sodium, and saturated fat are “high,” for example. This is preferable to just providing numeric information (like grams or percent Daily Value), which research has shown that consumers struggle to understand and use to make food selections, and is available in the Nutrition Facts Panel already.   <br/><br/>I also recommend a few changes to the proposed rule. The design the FDA proposed would appear on nearly all foods, which would make it harder for consumers to immediately understand which foods are high in key nutrients to limit. Most other countries in the Americas use a different type of front-of-package labeling system (“high in”) that only displays labels on products that are high in particular nutrients. An expansive body of scientific evidence from experimental studies and real-world evaluations supports the adoption of a “high in” FOPNL system. Such labels have been shown to improve the nutritional quality of consumers’ food choices, promote understanding of the nutritional contents of foods, and prompt food manufacturers to make healthy reformulations of packaged foods. I encourage the FDA to consider the vast body of evidence showing “high in” labels are effective and to modify the proposed FOPNL design to reflect that evidence. This could be done by shifting to a “high in” labeling system.  <br/><br/>I have two additional recommendations to ensure the final rule protects children’s health. First, the FDA’s proposed FOPNL system should apply to foods marketed for infants and toddlers in addition to foods marketed for individuals 4 and older, to which the rule is currently restricted. Parents would benefit from having up-front information about the foods they are purchasing for their very young children. Second, evidence from other countries suggests that the food industry responds to the adoption of FOPNL by adding more non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) to the food supply. These additives are not recommended for children by leading national public health and nutrition organizations. Several countries have begun to mandate NNS disclosures on the front-of-pack as part of the FOPNL system, and this action has been associated with reduced levels of NNS in the food supply. I therefore encourage the FDA to mandate a front-of-package NNS disclosure to accompany the FOPNL system that indicates when products contain NNS, and that they are not recommended for children. <br/><br/>The time has come for bold action to improve our nation’s diet and health. Please prioritize this evidence-based policy and finalize a strong FOPNL final rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Heather Schwendner

When hospital systems employ non-compete clauses, they force well-qualified doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to either stay in an environment that they determine to be causing burnout or pack up their lives and move to another city or state. This is not good for patients as they are forced to establish with new healthcare providers as they cannot follow their existing provider to a new location close by.

INFO - Comment: Dear BLM 2023-0005-0001,<br/><br/>I commend the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Department of Interior, and the Biden administration for proposing long-needed updates to the oil and gas leasing on our federal public lands. Today's federal oil and gas program is antiquated and jeopardizes outdoor experiences, recreation economies, and the future prosperity of public land communities by prioritizing oil and gas over important uses like hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, and other everyday activities.<br/><br/>This necessary rule helps fix this outdated system by establishing a fair return for taxpayers and ensuring that our public lands are better managed for all uses to prevent future conflicts between outdoor recreation and the oil and gas industry. In turn, it will allow rural communities to provide high quality of life through access to natural places, attracting both visitors and business investment.<br/><br/>The policies outlined in the rule propose a more balanced approach to managing our shared resources. Applying the rule's &quot;leasing criteria&quot; to future lease sales will help reduce conflicts with wildlife, cultural, and outdoor recreation resources. The criteria will also reduce the practice of &quot;speculative leasing.&quot; Our country's current speculative leasing practices tie up public lands in unproductive leases for decades, discouraging investments in new trails and outdoor recreation assets. These assets have become reliable economic drivers bringing both tourism and business investment, as more and more companies and professionals choose to live where there is access to healthy landscapes.<br/><br/>Additionally, there is an opportunity to strengthen the ruleWhile these measures will ensure that the B is LM better manages all of its resources, the rule should be strengthened by requiring that lands found to have a low preference for leasing &ndash; whether it is due to a lack of development potential, or the presence of important wildlife habitat, or local demand for recreation assets &ndash; are excluded from future sales.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also takes long-overdue action to increase bonding rates to a reasonable level, ensuring that oil and gas developers who profited from drilling pay the actual cost of restoration. The current amount companies must cover before they begin drilling was set over 60 years ago. These bonding rates have never been increased to account for inflation or the costs of cleaning up modern wells. Without these reforms, many communities across the west are on track to have thousands of abandoned wells polluting nearby public lands, waters, and air. If we continue to fail to provide sufficient bonding for capping wells at the end of their life cycle, we will leave community after community with no hope of utilizing their public lands for outdoor recreation. Without a bonding increase, when large oil and gas developers sell wells to smaller local operators, funds are not available to update well pad equipment or restore spent wells, and the burden falls on taxpayers and local residents.<br/><br/>The BLM's new requirements would ensure companies cover the actual, expected clean-up costs for current and future oil and gas activity on public lands and federal mineral areas. Additionally, the rule requires increased oversight of idled wells which will protect taxpayers from cleaning up future messes, and ensure that nearby public land communities will have a future.<br/><br/>I also support the proposed rule's implementation of the onshore oil and gas program reforms included in recent legislation. The proposed rule permanently increases the fees required to lease and drill on public lands and federal mineral areas, bringing those payments up to the same levels required by many states in the West and across the country. While legislation mandates that these rates and fees remain the same until 2032, the proposed rule rightfully allows those rates to increase after that year. I thank the BLM for proposing that the minimum rental rates and mi<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms Karen Adamo<br/>74 Forester St  Long Beach, NY 11561-2435

The laws in our country must protect those who are at risk for and survive these attacks, and I am concerned that the proposed changes will weaken protection for the most vulnerable. In particular:<br/>- The proposed hearings would allow representatives of alleged assailants to directly cross-examine complainants, which is wholly unnecessary and inherently intimidating, especially to students making the already difficult decision to come forward.<br/>- Complainants and witnesses must not be questioned in a manner that causes further trauma<br/>- Narrowing the scope of what constitutes sexual harassment risks leaving serious misconduct unaddressed, especially at schools that adopt the higher evidentiary standard. The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) and schools nationwide have effectively applied the current definition for decades. Suddenly permitting schools to disregard any sexual misconduct that does not overcome new and unnecessary hurdles is equally confounding. These and other proposed rules by ED will seriously impede students abilities to obtain redress for wrongdoing.<br/>- The proposed rules significantly weaken OCRs authority to enforce Title IX. In stark contrast to its current enforcement powers, OCR would not require changes to a schools process unless it determines the school is deliberately indifferent, an incredibly high standard. Applying these standards to other areas of OCRs jurisdiction, if that is EDs intent, will also undermine important civil rights laws that protect students from racial and disability discrimination.

Any remedies contemplated in Chapter 421 of U.S. Code Title 46, section 42101 would be unwarranted under the current circumstance. An inquiry is not only unnecessary, but inappropriate.<br/><br/>On November 4, 2024, reporting by the Intercept exposed that Maersk had facilitated over 2,100 shipments totaling tens of thousands of tons of military cargo to the Israeli Ministry of Defense through Spanish ports. Over a dozen Maersk ships have violated the Spanish arms embargo against Israel, because over 900 of the 2,100+ shipments called and docked in Spain after the 15th of May 2024 (when the Spanish arms embargo went into effect). Upon release of these findings, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that they would immediately investigate this, and they resultantly blocked the Maersk Seletar and Denver from docking in their ports. <br/><br/>Spain’s blocking of these ships is not only within their purview as a sovereign, but is a legal obligation. The cargo carried on Maersk ships, provided by the US Government, contributes to war crimes, crimes against humanity, the crime of genocide, violations of the 4th Geneva Convention and Additional Protocols, and violations of international legal norms. For example, these ships are confirmed to have carried Oshkosh tactical vehicles, the same ones that have been used in the mass kidnapping and disappearance of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Forced population transfer is unlawful under the Fourth Geneva Convention articles 49 and 127. Furthermore, the International Court of Justice has invoked all states’ obligation erge omnes to intervene on Israel’s grave violations of international law. The US should fulfil their obligations under international law by ceasing their arming of Israel, and the government should certainly not stand in the way of Spain’s legally and morally necessary arms embargo.<br/><br/>While the American people continue to struggle with basic needs, the federal government continues to back a genocide to the tune of 20 billion dollars.

In order to protect this rare species, we need to take correct measures to protect their habitats, open up population corridors, and reduce the impact of human activities on their living environment to help this species achieve sustainable development. The disadvantage of humans capturing and breeding in captivity is the loss of genetic diversity, which eventually leads to the extinction of the population. This is not real protection, so I oppose the Greater Washington Zoo's lease of Bao Li Qing Bao to the Washington Zoo for breeding.

I applaud USDA for this change.  Added sugars are a significant source of excess calories, have no nutritional value, and can contribute to weight gain.  Limiting the amount of added sugars in products like cereal, toaster pastries, yogurt, and flavored milk, will reduce added sugars consumption and improve kids health.  <br/><br/>I am glad the standards also emphasize the importance of whole grains.  Whole grains are a valuable source of nutrients and dietary fiber.  I urge USDA to keep the whole grain standard strong and require schools to meet the alternative option and serve whole grain-rich foods at least four days a week.   <br/><br/>Im pleased the standards also focus on the amount of sodium in school meals.  Nine of out of 10 children eat too much sodium, and excess sodium puts kids at risk of developing elevated blood pressure at an early age.  I support USDAs proposal to gradually reduce the amount of sodium in school meals over time, and the proposed reductions are a good next step, but Id like to see more significant reductions in the future.  I encourage USDA to work with schools and the food industry to further reduce the sodium content of school meals to align with the Dietary Guidelines.  Reducing sodium is one of the most important things schools can do to improve kids cardiovascular and overall health.<br/><br/>I urge USDA to move forward with the proposed rule  and to keep the standards strong.  All children deserve healthy, nutritious foods at school and the proposed standards are a significant step in that direction.

By making sure that federal purchasing dollars go to greener buildings and materials, lower- and zero-emission vehicles, and other more sustainable purchases, President Biden and his administration can provide a needed boost in the transition to a clean energy economy and incentivize the private sector to move in a more sustainable direction.<br/><br/>The 2018 National Climate Assessment found that the climate crisis could slash about a tenth of our economy by the end of the century. That economic contraction dwarfs any negative impact that strong climate procurement standards could have on an individual firm.<br/><br/>We must use every tool in the toolbox to fight the climate crisis. I support President Biden’s rule.<br/><br/>Laura Esparza<br/>leesparza14@gmail.com<br/>1318 Viewridge Dr<br/>San Antonio, Texas 78213

INFO - Comment: This proposed rule put women back to the same position in history and frame of mind to the time in which they couldn't vote or do certain jobs, because it is a man's job.  Not to mention the fact that to openly allow a man to enter an area that should be a protected safe place for a woman like a bathroom is incredibly immoral, unsafe and invades the privacy of a woman.  <br/><br/>To allow men (anyone with the xy chromosome) to compete in sanctioned sports with the opposite gender (those with xx chromosome) is also unfair to the women on so many levels.  On the overwhelming majority, men have advantages physically that would allow them to dominate pushing women out of the sports arena, losing their place in scholarships, lively hood and other opportunities that are now available to them.<br/><br/>I am writing in opposition to this rule redefining sex as used in Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.<br/><br/>For fifty years, Title IX has provided important protections and opportunities for women by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex. While parents across the country are demanding the rejection of "woke" policies, the Department of Education instead has chosen to hijack Title IX to force gender ideology on children without their parents' knowledge or approval.<br/><br/>If this rule is approved, biological males would be able to:<br/><br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Openly change in girl's dressing rooms.<br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Take college and university scholarships specifically reserved for women.<br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Use their position to charge schools with discrimination if they feel they aren't getting enough "playing" time.<br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>File a formal sexual harassment complaint against any female who speaks out against men in women's sports.<br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Share hotel rooms with females during overnight trips.<br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Enjoy physical advantages like greater lung capacity, higher bone density, and greater muscle mass.<br/><br/>This proposed rule is a lawless interpretation, allows for unfair play, and is a complete overreach by the Department of Education.

Plus, when airlines know their fares will be listed next to their competitors, they will be more likely to offer a competitive price. <br/><br/>It's come to my attention that some airlines are trying to make it harder for me to see all my options by restricting certain websites from publishing fare and schedule information. They shouldn't get to pick and choose who can share information that's already publicly available.  We need more transparency in the marketplace, not less.

INFO - Comment: USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack,<br/><br/>I am writing to voice my support for the USDA’s proposal to strengthen nutrition standards for school meals. Building on the historic progress of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, this rule proposes limiting added sugars in school meals for the very first time. School meals that are limited in added sugars and sodium and contain whole grains can help introduce healthy eating habits and can help mitigate chronic health conditions.<br/><br/>Added Sugars: School breakfasts are far too sugary, and I applaud the USDA’s proposed cap of no more than 10 percent of calories from added sugars, which mirrors the Dietary Guidelines recommendation. I also support USDA’s product-specific added sugars limits.  <br/><br/>Sodium: While these sodium reduction goals represent progress, the final limits do not go far enough and are out of alignment with the Dietary Guidelines’ quantitative recommendations. For instance, children up to age 8 will get 83 percent of their daily recommended sodium limit from breakfast and lunch combined, leaving just 17 percent leftover for snacks and dinner. A 13-year-old will get 77 percent of their daily limit from school breakfast and lunch, and high school students will get 63 percent.<br/><br/>Whole Grains: The two options proposed by the USDA require less than half of grains offered be whole, which is not aligned with the Dietary Guidelines’ recommendations. I encourage the USDA to strengthen the whole grain-rich requirement.<br/><br/>Healthy, wholesome meals provide children the nutrients they need to grow, develop and learn in and out of the classroom, and the 30 million kids who rely on school meals every day deserve better. It’s time to stop appeasing industry and put the health of kids first.<br/><br/>John Clark Pontius<br/>jcpontius8@gmail.com<br/>608 E Liberty St<br/>Wauconda, Illinois 60084

INFO - Comment: As someone who travels almost 100 trips a year and has for many years allowing emotional support animals has been a joke. I've been next to many through out the years and the owners do not control their animals at all. They beg for food, they bark at people, I've had one attempt to bite me, I've seen it all. What I typically don't see is an owner who watches the animal and most times are ignoring them, which if you need for support seems like they would be overly protective.  I think airlines need the support to better contain the animal.  They need to be in an animal carry on bag or cargo hold. My comments do not apply to authorized, legitimate service animals who are well trained, never seen or had an issue with a true service animal.

Glutathione helps patients with a wide variety of ailments, including liver disease, cancer, stroke, and autism. Please protect access to this critical medicine.<br/><br/>A glutathione ban would be a disaster. It has many medical applications and there is no commercially available glutathione drug, so a ban would mean no more glutathione IVs. Glutathione is used widely for a variety of conditions because of its role in reducing oxidative stress-an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body.<br/><br/>Glutathione's usefulness is backed by dozens of studies for a multitude of conditions. It helps with cancer treatment by reducing the side effects of chemotherapy; it helps with Parkinson's, pulmonary disease, autism, and COVID-19, to name a few. It's also key to detoxification.<br/><br/>Please protect access to this critical medicine.

INFO - Title: TX -- Hanna, James
INFO - Comment: I am a Texas physician who is extremely disappointed and disillusioned with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' draft rule to implement the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA). Physicians  as a profession and individually  are dedicated to constantly improving the quality of care we provide. But as I read it, this rule will wreak havoc with my practice while offering absolutely no evidence that it will do anything to improve patient care. <br/><br/>Here are my recommendations:<br/><br/>Since you won't finalize the rules until on or around Nov. 1, 2016, the Jan. 1, 2017, start date is completely unreasonable. Physicians need at least a six-month deferment to prepare our practices and processes for all the changes MACRA is demanding. Please begin the first period on July 1 and end it on Dec. 31. This deferment will be particularly critical for small practices.<br/><br/>Set the Low-Volume-Threshold high enough to exempt physicians who have no possibility of a positive return on their investment in the cost of reporting. The ongoing cost of reporting, on the quality measures alone, is more than $10,000 per year per physician, and physicians who undertake the reporting efforts can, on average, expect to avoid penalties but not earn incentives, Therefore I urge you to set the Low-Volume-Threshold in 2019 at $250,000 of Medicare revenue. At that amount, the avoided penalties at 4 percent would approximately equal the $10,000 cost of reporting. Below that amount there is no likely return that exceeds the costs of reporting. Below that amount, I urge you to make Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) reporting optional, but exempt from any penalties the physicians who attempt to comply.<br/><br/>Keep it simple. Reduce the proposed program requirements, simplify the scoring of each MIPS category, and establish a more equitable point system among all physicians and other eligible clinicians.<br/><br/>Establish objective and timely measurement and reporting systems that are simpler and less costly than those required under current programs like PQRS and meaningful use. The focus should be improving care for all Medicare patients, not creating yearly physician winners and losers with payment affected two years after care has been delivered.<br/><br/>Use quality metrics that capture those activities that are under the physician's control and have been shown to improve quality of care, enhance access-to-care, and/or reduce the cost of care. The focus should be on metrics that are most meaningful to our practices and our patients, not on what will result in the best "score."<br/><br/>Make feedback reports available during current reporting periods so that we physicians can correct errors and omissions in a timely fashion. Make the reports easy to access and understand, and include a process for physicians to request and implement revisions when data are incorrect.<br/><br/>Require electronic health records vendors to build and maintain products that meet federal specifications. Don't force us to have to vouch for their products. Don't force physicians to purchase and constantly upgrade expensive and often-balky systems.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I am dedicated to the goal of improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of the care I provide to my patients. Your proposed MACRA rule, however, will take medicine in the total opposite direction. Please chart a different course of action. Please take the time necessary to ensure that this new law supports and enhances the physicians who provide the medical care to our nation's 54 million Medicare beneficiaries. Please stop moving down a path that threatens to plow under tens of thousands of physician practices and needlessly create an access crisis for patients covered by Medicare.

INFO - Comment: For too long, the government has tracked and stored excessive information on the American people by simply buying it from data brokers online – including deeply sensitive personal info like health information and location data, which could be used by law enforcement to track visits to abortion clinics and more. And despite the Fourth Amendment protecting us against unreasonable searches and seizures, these purchases are often done out of the public eye and entirely without warrants – such as offices in the Department of Homeland Security that have bought and used cell phone location data from third parties. I’m urging President Biden and the Office of Management and Budget to protect our privacy by freezing federal purchases of personal information. Not only is this a massive invasion of privacy, but in the wrong hands, it could be downright dangerous – leaving us vulnerable to identity-based attacks and disenfranchisement.<br/><br/>Throughout history, the government has abused its surveillance authorities to go after political opponents, activists, communities of color, and other dissenters. That’s why safeguards like warrant requirements are so critical to protect our privacy. The issue here is simple: The government should not be allowed to purchase its way around bedrock constitutional protections for the privacy of Americans.<br/><br/>Carrying a smartphone and accessing the internet is such a basic part of our daily routine that it’s chilling to think that using these devices for something as essential as seeking the healthcare we need may lead to us being tracked or monitored by police and the government. The government can’t be allowed to buy its way into our private lives.<br/><br/>We, the people, have a right to know who’s seeing our data, what our data is used for, and how long the data is being stored for. With very few safeguards protecting our individual privacy – and current practices that are rife for abuse – I’m calling on the Biden administration to end warrantless purchases of our personal information.<br/><br/>Thank you for your efforts to handle commercially available information containing PII, and I appreciate your consideration of this comment.

INFO - Comment: I strongly oppose the proposal to roll back critical protections for brown bears and to allow the trapping of wildlife species without a federal permit on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. This regulatory change caters to a very small number of hunters and trappers at the expense of both wildlife conservation and the enjoyment of the refuge by all Americans. The US Fish and Wildlife Service should ensure that the wildlife species visitors come to see at the Kenai refuge are thriving, not disappearing. <br/><br/>The current proposals are intended solely to satisfy the interests of government officials in Alaska who want to permit unethical killing of brown bears and liberalize refuge trapping regulations; they are not mandated by federal law or required by any USFWS policy or directive. <br/><br/>According to a survey of visitors to Kenai National Wildlife Refuge in 2010-2011, only 4 percent of visitors participated in big game hunting during the previous year, with only 3 percent indicating that hunting was the primary activity that they participated in while visiting the refuge. In contrast, 57 percent of visitors reported participating in hiking, wildlife observation, and photography during their visit to the refuge. <br/><br/>Eliminating refuge oversight of trapping in Kenai, as well as allowing the baiting of brown bears, may please the relatively small number of people who hunt and trap on the refuge, but it is inconsistent with the interests of the majority of refuge visitors who engage in non-consumptive activities. It also may jeopardize the safety and enjoyment of the majority of refuge visitors if they were to inadvertently step on a trap or come into conflict with bears who have become acclimated to piles of human food. <br/><br/>Furthermore, we know how destructive the easing of hunting and trapping restrictions can be. The killing of bears over bait on adjacent state lands, a result of Alaska's rollbacks of bear hunting rules from 1995 to 2018, reduced bear populations so much that the USFWS had to institute emergency bear-hunting closures in Kenai in 2013-2014. History should be a lesson, and the USFWS should prioritize protecting wildlife and biodiversity.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I urge the USFWS to withdraw its proposal to allow bear baiting and trapping without a federal permit on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.

The rate of Salmonella illness hasn’t meaningfully changed in over 20 years, and poultry products are the top cause of illnesses.  <br/><br/>Breaded, stuffed, raw chicken products are causing significant harm to public health, representing five percent of outbreaks despite making up less than one percent of chicken products sold. The USDA is correct to take action on this, as previous attempts to better communicate handling and cooking practices to consumers have not been effective enough in stopping outbreaks associated with these products.   <br/><br/>I also urge the USDA to create final product standards for all poultry products, which are likely to cause illness when contaminated with high levels of dangerous types of Salmonella. The USDA’s current approach is obviously not working as well as it should to protect public health, because consumers continue to get sick from poultry products at unacceptably high rates. Creating these standards will stop dangerously contaminated products from reaching consumers. This will both protect consumers, like me, and motivate the industry to implement stronger food safety procedures from farm to fork.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Diana Grob<br/>Gresham, OR 97030

INFO - Comment: Dear Attorney General Garland,<br/><br/>I strongly support the proposed rule to ensure that individuals who are “engaged in the business” of selling firearms are licensed, thus requiring them to complete background checks for all firearm sales and maintain records of those transactions, and that dealers who have lost their licenses may no longer sell firearms to the public. A recent study found that more than 1 in 5 gun sales in the U.S. are conducted without a background check, amounting to millions of off-the-books gun transfers annually; many of these transactions are facilitated by individuals who profit from the repetitive sale of firearms yet avoid the necessary oversight required of licensed dealers. <br/><br/>This is a public health and safety issue, and I urge the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to finalize the rule in order to prevent firearm transfers to prohibited purchasers and ensure that individuals who are selling guns for profit are licensed, regulated, and engage in responsible business practices.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Nicole Punday

INFO - Comment: Dear Joseph Bayer,<br/><br/>I urge you to finalize federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for model years 2027-2032 at least as strong as the alternative providing a three percent increase per year for passenger cars and a five percent increase per year for light trucks, referred to as PC3LT5.<br/><br/>As gas prices continue to be unpredictable, with increases that are often straining household budgets, strong fuel economy standards are needed more than ever! CAFE standards are a simple and efficient pathway to true energy security, protecting drivers from gas price fluctuations by dramatically reducing oil demand. Strong standards will not only help protect American drivers from volatile gas prices, but will also prompt the auto industry to deliver more efficient vehicles.<br/><br/>CAFE standards incentivize manufacturers to invest in and apply technologies that improve overall vehicle fuel efficiency, saving consumers money at the pump. Industry innovation spurred by strong fuel economy standards has also prompted technology advancements that have made the current fleet of new cars and trucks in the United States the safest, cleanest, most fuel-efficient vehicles produced in our country which is good for the first owners of the vehicle and continues to offer savings into the future for drivers who buy used cars.<br/><br/>It's vital that we pass strong fuel economy standards. Compared to NHTSA's preferred alternative, the next most stringent standard (PC3LT5) would cut gasoline use and heat trapping emissions 27 percent more from vehicles sold through the 2032 model year. This translates to at least $12 billion back in the hands of consumers.<br/><br/>Strong fuel economy standards have support from the public and are critical tools in our toolbox to support household budgets and support the planet.  Again, I urge you to adopt the CAFE standards for model years 2027-2032—at least as strong as the PC3LT5.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Dr. Gregory Grether<br/>Topanga, CA 90290

The thoughtful use of the money provided in the ARPA ESSER by both State Education Agencies (SEAs) as well as Local Education Agencies (LEAs) will be critical to helping to ensure that schools are able to reopen safely and that they are able address both the immediate and lasting needs of students, schools, and educators due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. <br/> <br/>I was particularly pleased to see that ED requires both SEAs as well as LEAs to engage in meaningful consultation with stakeholders which includes students and families. As you are aware, parents and families have always been critical partners with the education system, and parents and families have become even more intimately involved in the day-to-day and sometimes minute-to-minute education of their child due to the nature of education during the COVID-19 Pandemic. I believe that as SEAs and LEAs develop plans to return safely to in-person instruction, maximize in-person instructional time, sustain the safe operation of schools, and address the academic, social, emotional, and mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the student, parent, and family voice is more important than ever. <br/> <br/>Therefore, as you work to finalize these requirements, I strongly urge that families and students remain on the list of stakeholders with whom both SEAs and LEAs must consult. Additionally, either through this rule, guidance, or review of state applications, I urge the Department to work with SEAs and LEAs to ensure that stakeholder consultation is not a merely "check the box" exercise as is sadly too often the case, but rather is a truly meaningful, inclusive, and accessible process through which family and parent voices are actively sought and heard. <br/> <br/>Thank you for your consideration.

But the proposed rule would allow federal contractors to use religious to justify discrimination against working people. Its illegal for employers to discriminate based on sex -- including based on sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, gender identity, and pregnancy and related-medical conditions. This rule would weaken these important antidiscrimination protections and threaten working peoples economic security, their health, and their reproductive freedom.<br/><br/>Employers religious beliefs about womens behavior or role in society, their family life, and their reproductive health decisions have long been used to justify discrimination. This rule would allow federal contractors to fire a person for being pregnant and unmarried, or for using birth control or assisted reproductive technologies, or to refuse to hire an LGBTQ individual. Working people shouldnt have to worry about being able to get and keep a job, or being able to make their own reproductive decisions, because of who they are, whether and to whom they are married, and whether, when and how they have children. Employers who have the privilege of doing business with the federal government should be required to treat their employees fairly.

INFO - Title: Certain Medical Care Arrangements (REG-109755-19)
INFO - Comment: I am grateful the government is moving to allow citizens greater control over their Health Savings Account (HSA) dollars.  Adding Direct Primary Care (DPC) medical services provided by doctors is long overdue as an HSA Qualified Medical Expense.<br/><br/>In a system that has grown over decades to a dizzying size and complexity, subscribing to a local doctor for medical services creates a simple path for patients to get immediate low cost care.<br/><br/>However, there is a Trojan horse in the rule.  By identifying Direct Primary Care as a health plan, the rule opens the door to an avalanche of regulatory control. The reason Direct Primary Care works so well for doctors and patients is that it opts out of these layers of bureaucracy.<br/><br/>By defining Direct Primary Care medical subscription services as a health plan, it opens these independent doctors offices across the nation to the regulatory control of State insurance commissioners.<br/><br/>Direct Primary Care is NOT A RISK BEARING ENTITY. It is an agreement to provide health care services provided by a doctor to a patient.  Patients must continue to maintain health insurance for catastrophic care  something outside the scope of the local doctors office (and Direct Primary Care).<br/><br/>The old adage, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, is the sweet spot for Direct Primary Care.  By maintaining the business freedom of Doctors, Direct Primary Care is a medical service that is incentivized to provide high quality care for the lowest price the market will bear.<br/><br/>80% of all health care issues can be resolved through a local doctors office.  Patients who see a DPC physician have a +40% reduction in ER utilization and a +19% reduction in hospitalization.<br/><br/>No further regulation is needed beyond that already provided by State licensure, OSHA, standards of care enforced via malpractice law, etc.<br/><br/>Using HSA dollars for medical service subscriptions is a private business partnership between a patient and their doctor.<br/><br/> Please DO NOT define Direct Primary Care as a health plan.<br/><br/> Please DO NOT put limitations on how the HSA dollars are spent beyond going to licensed health care providers.<br/><br/> Please ALLOW personal contributions to HSAs when a patient has a Direct Primary Care doctor. Under the current rule, Direct Primary Care is considered a second health plan and thereby patients are prohibited from making their own HSA contributions  which is self defeating for the goal of the rule  expanding low cost, high quality care to rural and underserved communities.<br/><br/>

The Obama-era rule set it at $47,476high enough to cover about 34 percent of full-time salaried employees but lower than the level that it was in the 1970s. Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people. The whole point of having national standards is to ensure decent basic standards for all workers. The updated overtime standard is already linked to the lowest-wage Census region.

INFO - Comment: I urge you to reject any proposal to weaken the Forest Services National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA] process, and keep the law as it is. NEPA ensures that our communities have a say in major federal decisions that affect our public lands, health and safety. It is often the only way for people to voice their concerns about the consequences federal projects will have for their communities and demonstrate how local expertise can improve them. Our communities are safer and healthier because of NEPA.<br/><br/>While some argue that environmental analysis required by NEPA takes too long and results in bulky, unhelpful documents, such outcomes are caused by funding, staffing and training issues wholly unrelated to following the law. Instead of amending its NEPA regulations, the Forest Service should fight for more funds, personnel and education to ensure effective environmental review and public participation. <br/><br/>The Forest Service manages 193 million fragile acres of our national forests and grasslands from Puerto Rico to Alaska, from lands close to cities to remote wilderness. The Forest Service should conduct thorough analysis and weigh the irreversible consequences of each project the agency considers. These are serious decisions that deserve the hard look at environmental impacts that NEPA requires. <br/><br/>Robust public engagement and sound science are essential to informed decision making. This is, and must remain, the publics right under NEPA. When we take the time to understand each other, we can jointly develop solutions to manage our public lands. Undercutting our founding environmental law in the name of streamlining is not and never will be the answer.

INFO - Comment: I am writing to urge the National Marine Fisheries Service to immediately enforce the Marine Mammal Protection Act Section 101 by banning swordfish imports until exporting countries demonstrate that their swordfish catch meets U.S. standards for protecting marine mammals.  This 36-year-old law protects dozens of species of dolphins, porpoises, sea lions, whales, and other species I care about while safeguarding U.S. fishers from unfair competition with unregulated foreign fishing fleets.  The time is long overdue to enforce the law and ban swordfish imports.<br/><br/>Congress recognized that fishing posed a threat to marine mammal species when it passed this provision of the Marine Mammal Protection Act over 30 years ago.  Enforcement of Marine Mammal Protection Act provisions for U.S. fisheries has led to the establishment of significant protective measures aimed at restricting harmful fishing practices and protecting marine mammal populations from unsustainable fisheries bycatch.  Congress also recognized that, if the United States' efforts to protect marine mammals from fisheries bycatch were to be successful, it would have to exert pressure on fisheries of other nations to adopt similarly protective measures.<br/><br/>The Marine Mammal Protection Act requires that all fisheries meet a "zero mortality rate goal" - in other words, that they reduce incidental death and serious injury of marine mammals to as close to zero as possible. This requirement has led to a number of important regulations on U.S. fishing, including gear-based requirements such as the use of pingers and net extenders, limits on the length of longlines, and as other measures like time-area closures, safe handling and release training and equipment, and mandatory observer coverage. All of these measures play a vital role in reducing fisheries' impact on populations of marine mammals and other species.<br/><br/>Banning swordfish imports until source countries demonstrate that they meet these important standards would use U.S. market power to protect marine species I care about around the world and protect the economic interests of domestic fisheries. Therefore, I strongly urge the National Marine Fisheries Service to implement the ban immediately. Thank you for your attention to this important issue.

As a national park lover, this is especially troubling to me since so many national parks face threats from development on their doorsteps.<br/><br/>Additionally, NEPA has long guaranteed the democratic right of community members like me to directly engage with the planning process of these projects. These proposed revisions limit the ability for communities to offer valuable input that has historically saved taxpayer money and accounted for local expertise. <br/><br/>Finally, sweeping revisions like this deserve more time and public consideration than the given 60 days.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Debra Haaland,<br/><br/>I am writing to you today to express my opposition to Gulf-wide leasing in the oil and gas lease sales 259 and 261. <br/><br/>The Inflation Reduction Act does not require the administration to lease the entire Western and Central Gulf. Nor does it mandate any particular results from those sales. Rather, Congress, through both the IRA and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, empowered Interior to determine the size, location, and conditions for offshore leasing sales and preserved Interior’s authority to decide whether to issue a lease. And BOEM has the obligation to make those decisions based on a full evaluation of the environmental effects that leasing will cause – including climate pollution, oil spills, and harms to the critically endangered Rice’s whale. <br/><br/>There is simply no need for BOEM to continue with the large-scale lease sales we saw for four years under the Trump administration. Oil companies currently hold close to 1,900 leases covering more than 10 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico. Only about 500 of those leases are currently in production, meeting the current demand for offshore oil and gas and leaving more than 7.4 million leased acres (or 75% of current lease holdings) remaining to be developed to meet any near or mid-term national energy needs. <br/><br/>Moreover, massive area-wide lease sales are fundamentally incompatible with the Biden administration’s commitments to fight climate change. Decisions we make now about additional leases have no effect on current or even near-term energy needs because new leases typically take a decade to produce any oil. And because of the long-term nature of oil and gas development, leasing now locks in investments in fossil fuels for decades to come, long after the time when the United States and the world must transition to a clean energy economy if we are to avoid the more catastrophic impacts of climate change.   <br/><br/>Finally, continuing with massive leases sales increases the already dire harm to Gulf wildlife – like the 50 remaining critically endangered Rice’s whale – and to Gulf communities, which have disproportionately borne the brunt of the country’s fossil fuel addiction for far too long. Locking in new leases means locking in continued harm for decades to come and will only slow the needed rapid phase-out of fossil fuel from the nation’s energy portfolio.   <br/><br/>I urge you to not sell off millions of acres of Gulf leases and to use your authority and ample discretion to instead accelerate the rapid transition to the clean energy future the country needs!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Hilde WALTMAN<br/>Ocala, FL 34481

INFO - Comment:  ,<br/><br/>I strongly oppose the proposed rule on the standard for determining joint-employer status which is now being considered by the Department of Labors Wage and Hour Division.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Labor laws provide employees with essential safeguards with respect to minimum wage, overtime, and child labor. The proposed rule, however, sides with corporate interests -- pitting business owners against workers.  I would like to take a moment to officially register my opposition. We must strengthen -- not weaken -- our workforce laws and protections.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Increasingly, major corporations are working to dodge their obligation to follow labor laws by outsourcing employment to temp and staffing firms or other subcontractors, and creating the possibility that they can escape any liability for violations. This rule change, which would narrow the scope of the Fair Labor Standards Act, will confuse workers and embolden employers to outsource and then ignore their workers.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Simply put, joint-employer standards ensure workers have remedies against the contracting company for any legal violations.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to stand up for working people and fulfill its mission to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners  improve working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and assure work-related benefits and rights.  <br/><br/> <br/><br/>This proposed DOL rule change would redefine the joint employer standard and undermine the Labor Departments own stated goals by making it possible for the companies to avoid their liability by having contractors assume all responsibility for violations.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Pamela Coker<br/>broncopam67@q.com<br/>1505 E 12th St<br/>Pueblo, Colorado 81001

Recommendations to the food industry and food retailers on how to make a healthy diet more accessible for all Americans—like reducing sodium, saturated fat, and added sugar in the food supply— should be included.  <br/><br/>Though the Committee did not consider sustainability, several of their recommendations would have a positive impact for planetary health as well as public health. I urge you to promote environmentally sustainable diets in the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines to the greatest extent possible.   <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Winston Huang

INFO - Comment: Director of the Office of Sustainable Fisheries Alan Risenhoover 1315 East-West Highway, SSMC 3 Silver Spring, MD 20910    I'm deeply concerned about the impact of your agency's fishery management decisions on ocean ecosystems. I believe that strong environmental review is critical to the health of our oceans. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has made it possible to protect thousands of square miles of deep sea coral formations, save the lives of endangered sea turtles and begin rebuilding of depleted fish populations. #####################################################I agree with these statements and urge you to draft a new nepa rule which would truly protect our fisheries based on sound science.thankyou. randy sailer########################################################3 Unfortunately your agency's proposed NEPA rule hands over too much authority to fishery management councils that have a long history of poor management, significantly limits the public's ability to participate in fishery management decisions, and allows fishery managers to make decisions about fishing without fully considering the impacts on marine ecosystems including sea turtles, seals, corals and other precious ocean life.  Please withdraw this flawed NEPA proposal and craft a new one that will ensure protection of our ocean ecosystems. Our oceans are in trouble. I've seen in my own life how decades of mismanagement have degraded the oceans. It's time for our nation's fisheries managers to make better decisions by fully understanding the consequences of fishing on marine ecosystems.   Thank you for your time and consideration.

INFO - Comment: I am writing to oppose your proposal to rescind the regulatory definition of “harm” under the Endangered Species Act. <br/><br/>Habitat destruction is the main driver of species decline. When Congress passed the Endangered Species Act, it explicitly recognized the importance of habitat in protecting and restoring endangered species. And the definition of harm you seek to delete was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court 30 years ago. If anything, the case for habitat protection under the ESA has grown even stronger since then, with mountains of scientific evidence linking habitat and species’ survival.   <br/><br/>There is no rational reason to rescind this definition; rescission only serves as an invitation to timber, oil, mining and other extractive industries, as well as the government and individuals, to try to destroy habitat that endangered species need to live, eat, and raise their young. Common sense, science, and the ESA itself tells us that habitat destruction harms species.  <br/><br/>Just one company or project can destroy habitat, but when a species disappears, we all suffer the consequences, which can include impacts to our food and water supply, to industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to tourism, and to our cultural and spiritual values.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Fran King<br/>Marina, CA

Almost all private health plans, even those sponsored by many religious organizations, will be required to pay for or facilitate coverage for sterilization and all FDA-approved "contraceptives," including drugs that can cause abortion.  This coverage will be provided "automatically" to employees and their dependents, including minors, whether the employees want the coverage or not. Employers will have no right to act on their values when they provide health coverage. Employees, and those who provide or purchase health insurance outside the employer context, will have no freedom to opt out.  <br/><br/>I urge you to allow all organizations and individuals to offer, sponsor and obtain health coverage that does not violate their moral and religious convictions.

INFO - Comment: While I fully support recovering a healthy grizzly bear population in the North Cascades of north-central Washington, I oppose the use of a 10(j) rule in the restoration work, which would designate threatened grizzly bears moved to the North Cascades as a “nonessential experimental population.”<br/><br/>Under a 10(j) rule, grizzlies that are fully protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in places like Montana could be taken from their homes, dropped into the North Cascades, and lose their previous protection. This is unethical and must not be allowed to happen.<br/><br/>The fact is, grizzly bears in the lower 48 states are threatened, and we don't have extra grizzly bears in the lower 48 states to capture and ship to the North Cascades, only to be killed. <br/><br/>A 10(j) rule makes it much easier to kill grizzly bears and treat a grizzly bear population in a way that the USFWS would not treat other grizzly bears in the lower 48 states.<br/><br/>A 10(j) rule also allows the USFWS to preclude any habitat protections which are necessary if bears are going to recolonize this landscape and eventually link up with other recovery areas. <br/><br/>A 10(j) rule also allows the federal agencies to avoid the normal ESA Section 7 consultation requirements, which otherwise require consultations among the federal agencies (in this case, especially the U.S. Forest Service) to avoid jeopardizing the grizzlies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, USFWS hasn't done the legwork for preparing communities and recreationists for the arrival of grizzly bears through basic Bear Smart and coexistence measures, which just means that conflicts will be more likely—and the results will inevitably be dead grizzly bears.<br/><br/>For all these reasons, I oppose the use of a 10(j) rule for the proposed grizzly bear restoration work in the North Cascades.

INFO - Comment: Dear Caroline Good,<br/><br/>I write to you as one of In Defense of Animals 250,000 supporters, to speak in support of the proposed rule to amend vessel speed regulations in relation to North Atlantic right whales. I also urge you to take more protective measures to ensure the survival of this species and to continue efforts to create ropeless fishing gear. <br/> <br/>As you know, there are less than 350 North Atlantic right whales alive, a number so low that for every one of them, there are 22,857,143 of us humans, and the most common threats to these beautiful and critically endangered whales are boat collisions and entanglement in fishing gear. The most vulnerable to boat collision deaths are mother whales with their calves. Recently, a whale known as Infinity and her calf were struck off the coast of Florida by a sportfishing yacht. Infinity suffered painful injuries and her calf sadly passed away.<br/> <br/>I support the proposed amendments to the vessel speed rule to expand the seasonal speed zone boundaries and to include boats from 35 to 65 feet long in the rule. I also support the change to mandatory dynamic speed zones. <br/> <br/>The proposed amendments to the vessel speed rule are a huge step in the right direction, but I encourage the NOAA Fisheries to take additional measures to protect right whales. <br/> <br/>First, the dynamic management areas should be implemented when a minimum of one right whale is detected, not three, which would include vulnerable mother-calf pairs. <br/> <br/>Second, the seasonal speed zone should be expanded to the New Hampshire border to protect whales in a wider range. <br/> <br/>Third, military vessels and federally owned and operated vessels should not be exempted from this rule. <br/> <br/>Finally, the rule should also establish year-long protections for right whales along New England where boat traffic is particularly high and right whales are known to be present year-round.<br/> <br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed amendment to the rule, and for working to protect North Atlantic right whales.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Evelyn Skidmore

INFO - Comment: As an adult tobacco consumer and a resident of Alabama, I am writing to oppose the ban on menthol cigarettes. Please do not move forward with this proposal that will repeat the same mistakes of prohibition of alcohol and cannabis. <br/><br/>Banning menthol cigarettes unfairly limits adult choices for tobacco products that are already highly regulated and age-restricted. Youth usage rates of cigarettes are the lowest in a generation.  Adult tobacco consumers 21+ should be allowed to buy menthol cigarettes if they want to.<br/><br/>This proposed ban could create an illegal market outside of all regulatory controls, including effective measures to keep tobacco products away from kids. If this ban takes effect, selling once legal products will suddenly become criminal activity.   History tells us that bans don't work.  Effective regulation and education are better solutions than creating illegal markets and increasing crime.<br/><br/>Please do not ban the sale of menthol cigarettes in the United States.  I ask you to consider other solutions before prohibiting any products.

The gunman fired more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition in 11 minutes, using semi-automatic rifles modified with dangerous firearm accessories designed to dramatically accelerate the rate of gunfire, commonly known as bump fire stocks.<br/><br/>These devices are intended to circumvent the restrictions on possession of fully automatic firearms in the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the National Firearms Act of 1934 by allowing an individual to modify a semiautomatic rifle in such a manner that it operates with a similar rate of fire as a fully automatic rifle, posing a substantial risk to public safety.<br/><br/>In the absence of immediate action by Congress, I urge ATF to finalize its proposed rule clarifying that bump fire stocks, along with other conversion devices that enable semiautomatic weapons to mimic automatic fire, qualify as machine guns under the National Firearms Act. And then Congress must act as wellto ensure that manufacturers cannot continue to endanger public safety by designing devices that imitate machine guns and subvert the law.<br/><br/>The continued presence of these dangerous devices puts all of our communities at risk, and both Congress and ATF must take action quickly to address this threat.

INFO - Comment: Dear U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Directors,<br/><br/>The most obvious problem with this Draft Environmental Assessment is that it doesn't consider certain information that is vital to properly and thoroughly analyzing the proposed action at hand: the proposed regulations changes to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.<br/><br/>The Draft Assessment unlawfully ignores global warming and climate change's profound impact on threatened and endangered species. Many species already listed as threatened or endangered are being affected by global climate change -- including, but certainly not limited to, the Sonoran pronghorn, piping plover, tidewater goby, grizzly bear, Quino checkerspot butterfly, desert tortoise, and Pitcher's thistle.<br/><br/>In this Draft Environmental Assessment, global warming information -- including recovery plans that explicitly mention global warming as threats -- is ignored entirely.  This purposeful blind eye is unquestionably unlawful given the main purpose of the Endangered Species Act: to recover listed species.<br/><br/>The alternatives in the draft document are illegally limited. It is evident from the proposed rule and the Draft Environmental Assessment that the agencies looked only at a preferred alternative of amending the well-established and largely successful Section 7 regulations.  The law requires you to take a hard look at the no-action alternative as well as other reasonable alternatives.  <br/><br/>The agencies must prepare a Draft EIS to better understand the environmental consequences of their action. The magnitude of federal agency involvement in the Endangered Species Act Section 7 process, and the agencies' own admission that their goal is to greatly reduce these consultations, by itself necessitates the issuance of a draft Environmental Impact Statement and fuller understanding of the impacts of this proposed rule.  <br/><br/>The consequences of this proposed rule would be massive, affecting over 1,000 listed species threatened with extinction, and hundreds of millions of acres of imperiled wildlife habitat.  The scope of this rule change cannot be overstated in very real practical terms.  <br/><br/>I ask that you extend the timeline for comments and issue an Environmental Impact Statement.<br/><br/>Thanks for your consideration.

For more than 40 years, the harm definition has protected endangered species by prohibiting acts that result in significant habitat modification or degradation that results in actual death or injury to a species.  <br/><br/>This prohibition has been absolutely critical to saving species from extinction. It has prevented cutting of old-growth forests where spotted owls nest, stopped development in Florida panther habitat, and so much more.  <br/><br/>Stripping the definition of harm to leave out habitat destruction will open the floodgates to developers, loggers, miners, oil and gas drillers, and others to destroy endangered species habitat, driving species to extinction in the process. <br/><br/>The harm definition has underpinned conservation of endangered species in biological opinions and habitat conservation plans for decades, requiring reasonable measures to avoid habitat destruction in exchange for incidental take permits. Rescinding the definition will upend this sensible approach and undermine existing protections that have prevented the extinction of more than 99 percent of species protected by the Endangered Species Act. <br/><br/>I strongly urge you *not* to finalize rescission of this definition and uphold our commitment to saving endangered species and the natural world.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ilya Speranza<br/>NY 11233

The Obama-era rule set it at $47,476high enough to cover about 34 percent of full-time salaried employees but lower than the level that it was in the 1970s. Thats why the salary threshold should be at least $47,476; and without indexing, the overtime pay rule will continue to erode and not keep pace with inflation. <br/><br/>When fully implemented, this updated rule extends overtime eligibility to 4.9 million more working people and makes it harder for employers to deny overtime to another 7.6 million working people who are already eligible.<br/><br/>I urge the Department of Labor to implement the new overtime rule, keep the salary threshold at at least $47,476 and keep the indexing to protect the rights and wages of working people. The whole point of having national standards is to ensure decent basic standards for all workers. The updated overtime standard is already linked to the lowest-wage Census region. Workers rights and wages should not be undercut even further by weakening the salary threshold.<br/><br/>Jason Hankey<br/>jasonhankey.1984@gmail.com<br/>116 mcdill Ave.<br/>Stevens Point, Wisconsin 54481

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Ryan Zinke,<br/><br/>Our national monuments and public lands and waters help define who we are as a nation by telling the story of our shared historical, cultural, and natural heritage. I am concerned that the recent Executive Order attempts to undermine our national monuments and to roll back protections of these public lands. Protected public lands are an important part of what makes America great. I strongly urge you to oppose any efforts to eliminate or shrink our national monuments.<br/><br/>Since President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act into law in 1906, 16 Presidents - 8 Republicans and 8 Democrats - have used the authority granted by the act to safeguard public lands, oceans, and historic sites in order to share America's story with future generations. These national monument designations are broadly supported from coast to coast and provide a myriad of benefits to local communities, including economic boosts from tourism, places to enjoy the outdoors, clean air and water, protection for ecologically sensitive areas, and windows into our country's history.<br/><br/>Sending a signal that protections for our shared history, culture, and natural treasures are temporary would set a terrible precedent. National monuments have been shown to be tremendous drivers of the $887 billion outdoor recreation economy and businesses rely on the permanency of these protections when making decisions about investing in these communities.<br/><br/>From Maine's magnificent Katahdin Woods to the colorful canyons of Utah's Grand Staircase-Escalante to the western history held in New Mexico's Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks, these landmarks, landscapes, and seascapes have value which far exceeds their physical features; they manifest the core democratic ideals of freedom, justice, and equality. They are our legacy to our children and our children's children, and a gift that belongs to all Americans.<br/><br/>I am firmly opposed to any effort to revoke or diminish protections for our national monuments. I urge you to support the following list of National Monuments and recommend that our current national monuments remain as they are today.<br/><br/>AMERICAN SAMOA<br/>Rose Atoll<br/><br/>ARIZONA<br/>Grand Canyon - Parashant<br/>Ironwood Forest<br/>Vermillion Cliffs<br/>Sonoran Desert<br/><br/>CALIFORNIA<br/>Giant Sequoia<br/>Carrizo Plain<br/>Cascade-Siskiyou<br/>San Gabriel Mountains<br/>Berryessa Snow Mountain<br/>Mojave Trails<br/>Sand to Snow<br/><br/>COLORADO<br/>Canyons of the Ancients<br/><br/>HAWAII<br/>Papahnaumokukea<br/><br/>IDAHO<br/>Craters of the Moon<br/><br/>MAINE<br/>Katahdin Woods & Waters<br/><br/>MONTANA<br/>Upper Missouri River Breaks<br/><br/>NEW ENGLAND<br/>Northeast Canyons and Seamounts<br/><br/>NEW MEXICO<br/>Rio Grande del Norte<br/>Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks<br/><br/>NEVADA<br/>Basin and Range<br/>Gold Butte<br/><br/>OREGON<br/>Cascade-Siskiyou<br/><br/>PACIFIC OCEAN<br/>Marianas Trench<br/>Pacific Remote Islands<br/><br/>UTAH<br/>Grand Staircase-Escalante<br/>Bears Ears<br/><br/>WASHINGTON<br/>Hanford Reach<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Rita Riis<br/>  Boulder, CO 80304

Occupying just 6% of their historic range in just four isolated populations, grizzlies are far from recovered. <br/> <br/>In March 2021, when the Fish and Wildlife Service did its last five-year review on the species, the agency determined that grizzly bears should keep their status as a threatened species. That_s still the case.  <br/><br/>Removing grizzlies_ federal protection would hamper needed connectivity between populations, threatening their genetic health. It would also pave the way for states to approve aggressive trophy hunting. <br/> <br/>For these reasons, you must keep grizzly bears protected under the Endangered Species Act.

INFO - Comment: Dear Council on Environmental Quality,<br/><br/>I urge you to strengthen the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and undo the egregious damage caused by the Trump administration’s actions that put the interests of polluters over the health and well-being of our communities. For half a century, communities have used NEPA to have a say in what projects are built in their neighborhoods and voice concerns about the consequences federal projects and polluting industries create. While I’m encouraged by the Biden administration’s actions to restore equity and certainty in federal decision-making under NEPA, half measures will not meet the demands of this moment. <br/><br/>CEQ must reverse the changes that allowed polluting industries to prepare their own environmental reviews and fundamentally diminished the role of alternative options to particular projects. Additionally, CEQ must roll back the harmful provisions that silenced communities and prevented their participation in projects in their backyards. I fully support CEQ’s efforts to restore the explicit requirement that agencies consider cumulative and indirect effects of projects that will ensure future decisions include the impacts of climate change. <br/><br/>Communities of color are leading the fight against polluting industries, and  NEPA must continue serving as a legal recourse that empowers them to fight for the clean air and clean water they have a right to. You have the opportunity to ensure NEPA will remain a critical tool that current and future generations can utilize to safeguard their communities. Restore NEPA now!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Nancy H Brown RPh<br/>1 Dunn Ln  Missoula, MT 59802-3602

INFO - Comment: My Outpatient clinic in Rural Oregon has a patient volume that is a majority Medicare patients. These patients do not have any other options to go to and must be seen by physical therapy to keep them active, off pain meds, and to stay in the work force. If these cuts are made, our business will have no choice but to limit the number of Medicare patients we can see or else we will go out of business or have to drastically reduce our patient care for these patients. Both of which would be a disservice to my community. Physical therapy is the one healthcare profession that has the highest potential to decrease overall healthcare cost and it does not make sense to decrease the reimbursement rate for the profession that is saving the rest of the healthcare system the most money. Please reconsider your decisions at the impact is immense and with either cause decreased level of care and/or PT clinics going out of business.<br/><br/>I write to express deep concern regarding the 9% cut to physical and occupational therapy services that has been included in the 2021 Proposed Physician Fee Schedule Rule for CY2021. <br/><br/>Deep cuts of this magnitude will impede my ability to continue providing services for seniors and individuals with disabilities, and the downstream effects will be severe for both patients and the overall healthcare system. Many physical therapy practices will be forced to close their doors and patients will be left with fewer care options. The lack of physical therapy services will be costly - it will lead to opioid misuse, increased infections, higher hospitalization rates, more senior falls, longer hospital stays and avoidable surgeries. <br/><br/>Additionally, I would like to share my support for the proposal to permanently allow physical therapists to provide, and receive reimbursement for, services via e-visits, remote assessment of recorded video and/or images submitted by an established patient, and brief communication technology-based services. While telehealth has been expanded to include physical therapy during the public health emergency, it has become clear that telehealth physical therapy services have helped to expand access while keeping patients safe. A permanent expansion of this rule would help us maintain that level of expanded access for patients in need.<br/><br/>The physical therapy community is eager to work with CMS to ensure that Medicare patients in need of care are not the hurt by the unintended consequences of this proposal. I hope you will re-consider moving forward with the reimbursement cuts proposed before finalizing this rule.

INFO - Comment: I am writing to respectfully encourage you not to move forward with this proposed rule (RIN 1024-AE38). It would repeal a scientifically sound rule from 2015 prohibiting the use of some of the cruelest hunting tactics against predators on national preserves in Alaska. Such tactics include killing mother bears and cubs at den sites with the aid of artificial light, baiting brown and black bears, killing wolves and coyotes with pups during their denning season, killing swimming caribou or killing caribou from a motorboat, and using dogs to hunt black bears.<p>Allowing the use of brutal hunting tactics on highly vulnerable wildlife, such as denning mothers and cubs, is not only unconscionable, but also unlawful. Congress provided a clear directive to the National Park Service to 'provide for the maintenance of sound populations of, and habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens of Alaska and the Nation' for the 'benefit, use, education, and inspiration of present and future generations' (16 U.S.C. 3101(a)). These extreme hunting methods, which are neither used nor endorsed by the majority of sport hunters, violate this directive.<p>These barbaric, scientifically baseless, and unnecessary tactics decimate predators on public lands and undermine protection of natural diversity solely to boost numbers of prey species and cater to trophy hunters. Predators play a critically important role in an ecosystem, ensuring both diversity and proper ecosystem function. Brutal hunting methods such as baiting, hounding, killing young animals, and killing animals at their den sites should have no place on national preserve lands.<p>The 2015 NPS rule is consistent with federal law and the best available science, was subject to public review and comment, and outlaws only the most extreme hunting tactics in Alaska. I strongly encourage NPS to reject this deeply troubling proposal, and urge the agency to keep the 2015 prohibitions in place.

But loopholes in the system—like the ones that allow unlicensed gun sellers to sell guns online and at gun shows without running background checks on their buyers—undermine it.<br/><br/>That’s why ATF’s proposed rule is so important and should be finalized. It will help close loopholes in our background check system that have, for decades, been exploited by bad actors like gun traffickers, straw purchasers, and other prohibited persons, including domestic abusers and convicted felons.<br/><br/>I support the proposed rule because it makes clear that firearms dealing can take place wherever and through whatever medium guns are bought and sold—whether that’s at a gun show or an online marketplace—and that certain conduct, like selling guns of the same or similar kind and type, constitutes firearms dealing. That means that these gun sellers will need to become licensed dealers and, as licensed dealers, run background checks.<br/><br/>The proposed rule won't just expand background checks and strengthen our background check system, but it will also save lives. That’s why I support the proposed rule and why I encourage ATF to finalize it.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Marivee Frayer

INFO - Comment: The notice-and-takedown process under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is heavily biased in favor of corporate copyright holders and too commonly used to censor content that is protected under fair use. This system has had dire effects on political expression, creativity, and commercial innovation on the Internet. The DMCA needs new safeguards to protect against abuse and companies that infringe on users' free speech need to be held responsible.<br/><br/>Under a court sanction (Lenz v. Universal Music) companies are able to use computer algorithms to scan content posted to the Internet for possible copyright violations and issue automated takedowns. This process is vulnerable to significant error and does not allow for judgements to be made about possible fair use exceptions, therefore resulting in the censorship of vast amounts of legitimate (i.e. legal) speech and creative expression on the Internet.<br/><br/>According to a recent study from Berkeley and Columbia law professors, nearly 30 percent of takedown notices are of questionable validity and would benefit from human review.<br/><br/>While the DMCA's safe harbor provisions are important for making an open, participatory Internet possible, the notice-and-takedown procedures that have been developed alongside them have disproportionately benefited corporate copyright holders and copyright trolls who seek to shut down legitimate competition and extract money from innocent victims.<br/><br/>The notice-and-takedown process puts the most important types of content at risk. Political speech can be censored at crucial moments in a campaign. Videos can be taken offline at moments when they are crucial for the survival of small businesses. This kind of damage can not be undone.<br/><br/>To balance the process, copyright holders need to have more responsibility for considering fair use when enforcing copyright laws. As sites like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter have become important public spaces, companies that issue takedown notices of content that is clearly protected by fair use should be held liable for violating individuals' rights to free speech.<br/><br/>Balance is desperately needed in the notice and takedown system. One step to creating that balance is to  impose statutory damages for companies that abuse the DMCA takedown process or fail to adhere to any fair use review. In particular, automated takedowns must be discouraged as they inhibit free speech and fair use of copyrighted works.

Therefore, a dietary exposure assessment for the purpose of assessing cancer risk is unnecessary." (SOURCE)<br/><br/>Huh? Do you understand this? The EPA is saying glyphosate is so incredibly safe that it is not even necessary to study its possible carcinogenic effects in humans. No science needed! The EPA simply waves a magic (Monsanto) wand and says, "Shazam! Glyphosate is safe enough to EAT!"<br/><br/>The EPA, of course, is sadly mistaken. It is apparently not aware of two crucial facts to consider in all this:<br/><br/>1) The Seralini study released last year showed an alarming increase in cancer tumors in rats that were fed glyphosate in their drinking water.<br/><br/>2) Monsanto has already been found guilty of committing scientific fraud by altering the results of "scientific" studies in order to trick regulators.<br/><br/>The "scientific" data proving glyphosate to be "safe" has been fabricated! And the EPA is basing its conclusions on fabricated, corporate-quackified junk science that has one purpose: trick regulators into thinking the deadly poison is safe, thereby vastly increasing the usage of the chemical by farmers.<br/><br/>

INFO - Comment: 1.  BUMP STOCKS DO NOT FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF MACHINE GUN UNDER THE NFA.<br/><br/>The Obama administration was correct when, in 2010, it determined that bump stocks did not convert semi-autos into fully automatic firearms.<br/><br/>Federal law says, in part, that a machine gun is a weapon that can fire automatically more than one shot ... by a single function of the trigger. The definition includes ...any part designed and intended solely and exclusively ... for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun... (26 U.S.C. 5845(b)) <br/><br/>According to this definition, a bump stock does not fall within this definition.<br/><br/>With a bump stock, each and every round is discharged as the result of an independent pull of the trigger.  So it is simply untrue that the bump stock assists the discharge of more than one round by a single function of the trigger -- no matter how fast the gun discharges rounds.  <br/><br/>One pull, one discharge.  This is the classic textbook definition of a SEMI-automatic firearm.<br/><br/>If the ATF were to illegitimately use a standard based on increasing the rate of fire to ban or regulate bump stocks, then what is to stop it from illegitimately holding that other rate-increasing devices -- like belt loops, sticks or fingers -- are machineguns as well?  YouTube abounds with examples of people using these items to increase the rate of fire of their semi-autos. <br/><br/> <br/>2. ATF HAS NO CONSTITUTIONAL OR LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BAN OR REGULATE BUMP STOCKS.<br/><br/>The ATF's statutory authority, contained at 6 U.S.C. 531, is very narrow.  Nowhere does federal law give ATF the general authority to regulate the safety of firearms, accessories, or parts.  This is important, because, if federal law did do this, then it could administratively ban semi-automatics, or handguns, or all guns. <br/><br/>Constitutionally, the Second Amendment says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Our rights are not privileges from the government that can be revoked or regulated at will. And regulating or banning bump stocks would serve as unconstitutional infringements.

INFO - Comment: In addition to the impact of seat dimensions as it directly relates to emergency evacuation, the FAA should also consider other aspects of safety that could be impacted by seat dimensions. Specifically, the impact of seat dimensions as it relates to social behavior, and the impact of behavior on other aspects of passenger safety. It has been reported in the press that violent behavior between passengers and between passengers and crew members is increasing. The stress on passengers caused by excessive crowding that is result of insufficient seat dimensions can lead to violence. This violence can be avoided by imposing regulations that require sufficient space to alleviate the stress from crowding. The consequences of passenger violence are real, and the injuries sustained are in fact a passenger safety issue. Also, it is foreseeable that antisocial behavior could impact other safety aspects including emergency evacuation. Although a scientific study may be necessary to define the best minimum seat dimension, insight into the probable results can be found by reviewing the current offerings airline provide for "premium economy". I urge the FAA to consider impact of seat dimensions as it relates to antisocial behavior in the determination of minimum seat dimensions.

However, FDA should not include a $10 minimum price requirement. In my opinion, FDA has no role in setting prices for products it regulates. In addition, a $10 dividing line is arbitrary in defining the high-quality cigars that I enjoy. Price does not dictate whether or not a cigar is in fact premium. Premium cigars come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes and prices. A $10 minimum price could result in many of the premium cigars I enjoy no longer being available, or being sold at an increased price. It would restrict my product choice while not addressing FDA’s public health goals. Therefore, I strongly believe that FDA should remove the $10 minimum price requirement from the definition of a premium cigar. Thank you for your time and consideration.

INFO - Comment: Dear Food and Drug Administration, <br/><br/>When finalizing this draft guidance, I urge the agency to convey that existing menu labeling requirements apply to menus on third-party platforms (TPPs). Posting calories on TPPs should be mandatory, not voluntary. <br/><br/>Rates of obesity and related chronic diseases among Americans have been increasing since the 1970’s, the same period that has seen a steady increase in average calorie consumption. Even a modest reduction in average daily calories consumed could meaningfully improve public health, and studies show that menu labeling reduces calorie consumption by 8% per meal.  <br/><br/>Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, certain restaurants (Covered Establishments) must provide calorie information on both physical and online menus and make other nutrition information available upon request. While most Covered Establishments are currently in compliance when it comes to menus at physical locations and on company websites, calorie labeling on TPP menus for the same establishments is severely lacking. A recent study found that across three popular TPPs, consistent calorie labeling was present less than 30% of the time. <br/><br/>Given that TPPs play a large and growing role in how Americans obtain food, the FDA must act to clarify that menus from Covered Establishments posted on TPPs are not exempt from menu labeling requirements. Doing so will ensure that regardless of ordering method, consumers have access to calorie information that is vital to making informed decisions about what to eat. <br/><br/>Separately, I urge FDA to issue regulations to require disclosure of added sugars information for restaurant menu items. The draft guidance states that such disclosure is currently voluntary, but FDA must make it mandatory so that consumers can access this information. State and local policymakers and researchers also need this information to develop and assess policies designed to reduce added sugars in restaurant meals. Policies like New York City’s Sweet Truth Act, which will require warnings on menu items with more than a day’s worth of added sugars, cannot fully take effect until FDA requires restaurants to disclose added sugars information.  <br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mark Brooker

These jobs are not glamorous and are predominantly held by immigrants from Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Ethiopia and numerous other African and Central American countries.  Their work of providing care, which is physically and emotionally demanding, allows elders to stay in their own homes in the community despite frailty and increased health needs. We have them to thank for taking care of a population that to many is invisible but is significant; the homebound elderly. <br/><br/>I am also aware of how undervalued and underpaid this work is, like many of the jobs that are primarily held by immigrants in America. Raising the fees to attain naturalization presents yet another barrier for hard-working immigrants to be afforded the right to be fully integrated members of our society. The proposed rule is short-sighted and shameful and does not represent American values or the people that make up our diverse and thriving communities. <br/><br/>I urge you to rescind these harmful proposals and keep access to the American Dream alive!

INFO - Comment: It is welcome news that the USDA is planning to revise its licensing requirements to ensure better compliance with the Animal Welfare Act (AWA).  For too long, the automatic relicensing of scofflaw breeders, animal dealers, exhibitors, and other entities has been at odds with sound enforcement of the law, and resulted in prolonged suffering for the animals who are at the mercy of these commercial operations.<br/><br/>I therefore support the USDA's proposal to set expiration dates for licenses and to require that licensees reapply and affirmatively demonstrate compliance with the Animal Welfare Act in order to receive a new license, under the following conditions:<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Affirmative compliance with the law must be demonstrated by a comprehensive evaluation of the facility's recent history of animal care, including unannounced (compliance or relicensing) inspections. A determination of compliance should not be made based on conditions at the facility at any one point in time.<br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Licenses should be valid for no longer than three years, during which facilities should receive at least two unannounced compliance inspections. <br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Individuals with a history of noncompliance should be prohibited from obtaining another license or working for another individual or business licensed under the Act.<br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>License applicants should be required to disclose animal cruelty convictions and violations of any other federal, state, or local laws regarding animals.<br/>5.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>If significant changes are made in an operation (an expansion in the number of species, an increase in the number of animals, or the addition of sites), the licensee must notify the USDA and must, once again, affirmatively demonstrate compliance.<br/><br/>Thank you.

INFO - Title: Comment on FR Doc # 2023-19177
INFO - Comment: Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers. <br/><br/>The ATF’s proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized. <br/><br/>1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale—or no sale at all—might require a license:<br/><br/>ATF’s rule claims that the agency has opted not to "establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year" that require licensure, and instead suggests that "even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."<br/>However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who "regular[ly]" and "repetitive[ly]" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple "firearms." <br/><br/>2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:<br/><br/>Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted "occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby." According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be "engaged in the business" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF’s rule provides no such assurances.<br/><br/>3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:<br/><br/>Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer—private gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court’s Caniglia decision in 2021. <br/><br/>In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called "welfare check." But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police—and the Biden administration—with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.<br/><br/>4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:<br/><br/>One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have "willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license." Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior. <br/><br/>Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF’s footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don’t! <br/><br/>5. ATF’s backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration: <br/><br/>So-called "Universal Background Checks" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime. <br/><br/>The Biden Administration described this as "moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation." And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales. <br/><br/>But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.

While transparency is important, it is crucial to balance it with privacy rights. Requiring the reporting of every transaction, even small ones, seems excessive and impractical. The focus should be on pursuing tax cheats rather than burdening everyday Americans. Additionally, the rapid growth of stablecoins necessitates a thoughtful approach to regulation. Striking the right balance between oversight and innovation is key. It is essential for the IRS to collaborate with industry experts to develop practical solutions that address the concerns of both taxpayers and the government. By doing so, the IRS can effectively target bad actors and tax cheats while respecting privacy and fostering the growth of blockchain technology.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Azar,<br/> <br/>I am writing in support of certain aspects of HHSOCR20190007, the proposed rule regarding section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. The proposed rule eliminates an Obama-era definition of "discrimination on the basis of sex" designed to force healthcare providers to participate in brutal abortions.  Instead the proposed rule clearly articulates longstanding laws protecting the rights of health care entities like doctors, nurses and hospitals to abstain from involvement in abortion. I support these changes.<br/> <br/>The current Obama-era regulations implementing section 1557 define "discrimination on the basis of sex" to include "termination of pregnancy" in a manner that goes far beyond the statutory authority provided to the Secretary.  For this reason the regulations was challenged in Franciscan Alliance v. Burwell and a district court issued a nationwide injunction against it.<br/> <br/>The proposed rules provide much needed clarity regarding the freedom of health care workers and facilities to practice medicine in accordance with their own judgement. Americans need and want access to quality healthcare providers.  A vast majority of health care providers do not engage in abortion.  At a time when our nation needs more, not less, healthcare workers and facilities, it is unconscionable to force them to carry out abortions or leave the medical field.<br/> <br/>This is a matter of access to healthcare. Abortion is not healthcare, rather it is the taking of a vulnerable life. We must ensure that healthcare providers allowed to continue providing life-affirming care to millions of Americans.  I support the provisions of the proposed rule eliminating the definition of "discrimination on the basis of sex" that includes "termination of pregnancy" and the application of longstanding protections for healthcare entities that refuse to participate in abortion.<br/> <br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Robyn Loughran<br/>Indiana

INFO - Comment: I strongly support the proposed rule to give the oceanic whitetip shark vital Endangered Species Act protections that will help stop the species’ decline and put it on the path to recovery. The proposed “4(d) rule” will protect oceanic whitetip sharks from the main threats to their existence—unsustainable commercial fishing and trade of fins and other parts. <br/><br/>Overfishing has caused global oceanic whitetip numbers to plummet by an estimated 80 to 99 percent. Targeted catch and incidental bycatch in commercial fisheries remain the greatest worldwide threats to the species. In addition, the species’ distinctive fins are highly valued in the international shark fin trade, providing a destructive incentive for fishing vessels to kill oceanic whitetip sharks caught as bycatch so they can sell their fins. <br/><br/>Inadequate regulatory mechanisms allow far too many oceanic whitetip sharks to be caught, injured, and killed every year. Even though the species has been listed as a threatened species since 2018, it has continued to decline. As the proposed rule recognizes, the oceanic whitetip shark cannot survive and recover unless it is protected from unsustainable fishing and trade. The proposed rule will give the species essential protections against take and provide additional means to combat the illegal shark fin trade in the U.S. It is our responsibility as ocean stewards to recover this magnificent species to healthy levels and restore its role as a key part of marine ecosystems. <br/><br/>For all of these reasons, I urge the Fisheries Service to adopt the 4(d) rule to fully protect oceanic whitetip sharks from take and trade.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Nichole Holden<br/>Marshalltown, IA

INFO - Comment: I urge the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to finalize the updated 2016 interim rule on importing into the United States and transporting salamanders across state lines to protect wild populations from the devastating fungal disease Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal).<br/><br/>This highly contagious fungus kills salamanders by attacking their skin, and while it has not yet reached U.S. salamander populations, similar fungi like Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) have already caused catastrophic declines in amphibian species worldwide. Now is the time to act, while we still have a chance to prevent Bsal from devastating our wild salamander populations and the ecosystems that depend on them. Salamanders play a critical role in maintaining biodiversity and controlling insect populations, and we must protect them before this disease has a chance to take hold.<br/><br/>This rule would also have the additional benefit of reducing suffering in the pet trade, which treats salamanders and other amphibians as commodities rather than sentient beings. At events like the Reptile Super Show, salamanders are crammed into tiny plastic tubs, denied proper care, and sold to buyers who are often unprepared to meet their complex needs. The exotic pet trade fuels animal suffering, depletes wild animal populations, and spreads disease — posing risks to both animals and their ecosystems.<br/><br/>Finalizing this rule is a necessary and proactive step to safeguard wild salamanders from a looming ecological disaster. I urge you to approve this measure to protect salamanders in their natural habitats while we still have the opportunity to act.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Lauren Horwitz<br/>New York, NY 10011-6728

INFO - Comment: Dear Administrator Revesz:<br/><br/>I agree with the Biden Administration and thank you for proposing these changes. The rulemaking process should be more inclusive, participatory, and equitable. Right now, there is too much corporate influence, and the process is not transparent. The administration’s proposals are the most important and impactful set of reforms to the rulemaking process in decades. I support many aspects of the proposed update to Circular A-4 and draft guidance on EO 12866 meetings, and urge the implementation of additional changes that build on this framework as soon as possible, such as ensuring that all aspects of the rulemaking process involving the public are accessible to people with disabilities and people who speak languages other than English. <br/><br/>Draft Guidance Implementing Section 2(e) of the Executive Order of April 6, 2023 (Modernizing Regulatory Review): EO 12866 meetings <br/><br/>An important part of making the rulemaking process more inclusive, participatory, and equitable is reforming the EO 12866 meetings process. EO 12866 meetings are meetings that members of the public can request with officials working in the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) about regulations under OIRA review. I support the Biden Administration making it easier for the public to request and attend these meetings so people’s voices can be heard on regulations that affect them. The administration must take all necessary and appropriate action to bolster public involvement in this important democratic process. In particular, “offering periodic and accessible public training on effective participation in EO 12866 meetings, in collaboration with agencies and civil society organizations so as to reach communities that might not have historically participated in the EO 12866 meeting process before,” is critical.<br/><br/>Circular A-4 <br/><br/>The proposed updates to Circular A-4 are good. I strongly support the long overdue reforms proposed by the Biden Administration to Circular A-4 that improve regulatory cost-benefit analysis. Cost-benefit analysis is an outdated and anti-public protections economic exercise that puts too much weight on the calculable costs of regulating versus the benefits of regulating that you can’t put a price on (i.e., human dignity and life, welfare, a better environment, clean air, and clean water). I thank the administration for recognizing this and making cost-benefit analysis work in the public interest. In addition, it is critical that the administration adopts the proposed reforms requiring analysis of distributional effects to ensure that regulatory cost-benefit analysis is accurately reflecting the overwhelming benefits that new public protections provide to vulnerable, disadvantaged, and marginalized communities.<br/><br/>Conclusion <br/><br/>I appreciate these long overdue changes to Circular A-4 and EO 12866 meetings and strongly support them. Thank you for your time and attention to my comment.

Removing habitat destruction from the definition of "harm" would severely weaken protections for endangered and threatened species. Habitat loss is one of the leading causes of extinction, and changing this definition would allow for greater destruction without accountability putting countless species at risk.<br/>The current definition rightly recognizes that injuring or killing wildlife includes significantly altering their habitat in a way that disrupts essential behaviors like breeding, feeding, or sheltering. This scientific and common-sense approach must remain in place. Please protect the intent and integrity of the Endangered Species Act by preserving the current definition of "harm" to include habitat modification. Our wildlife and ecosystems depend on it.

By not allowing agents or other service providers to charge fees to both lenders and applicants if they are involved in the loan for each, access to sub-$350,000 loans would be restricted as these agents or providers would be forced out of the market and banks would then not be able to serve these small businesses without the providers on which they rely. <br/><br/>Without access to already low-cost SBA-backed loans, some businesses will receive no financing at all while others will be pushed toward expensive lending markets and end up with much higher fees and interest rates.

Complying with premarket review, warning labels, and product testing will cost family businesses like J.C. Newman millions of dollars and force them to close. By FDAs own calculations, regulation will put 50% of all cigar companies in America out of business.<br/><br/>Since the Deeming Rule was adopted, new research has found that premium cigars (a) are not used by children; (b) are smoked infrequently by adults; (c) are distinct from other tobacco products; and (d) do not significantly increase the risk of mortality. The extreme costs of regulating premium cigars grossly outweigh any likely benefits.<br/><br/>I strongly support the comments submitted by the International Premium Cigar and Pipe Retailers Association, Cigar Rights of America, Cigar Association of America, J.C. Newman Cigar Company and many others who explain this issue in more depth. Please do not allow FDA regulation to crush historic premium cigar makers like J.C. Newman. Thank you very much for your consideration.<br/><br/>Respectfully,<br/><br/>Peter J Balames.    1-727-686-8365<br/>

INFO - Comment: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s proposed critical habitat rule for Canada lynx Is a step forward in one region and a major step backward elsewhere. <br/><br/>I support the proposed rule’s designation of critical habitat for threatened Canada lynx in the southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado and northern New Mexico, as well as its inclusion of additional areas in the northern Rocky Mountains and the North Cascades. As the planet faces increased threats from climate change, the high-elevation forests of the southern Rockies are essential to lynx conservation because they’re projected to retain habitat longer than some other areas. <br/><br/>But for this designation to be successful, it must preserve connectivity between the two new areas proposed in Colorado, as well as connectivity with other protected habitat further north, so lynx can safely roam to increase dispersal and genetic diversity. Therefore, more critical habitat must be added than currently proposed. In Colorado the designation should include the Mummy and Never Summer mountain ranges, enhancing connectivity northward, and the Cochetopa Hills to create connectivity between the two areas that the Service proposes. <br/><br/>I completely oppose all the reductions of protections in the proposed rule — especially its wholesale elimination of critical habitat in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem and the smaller but still damaging reductions of critical habitat elsewhere in the northern Rockies and North Cascades. These cuts would greatly undermine lynx survival and recovery. Lynx need more protected habitat — not less.  <br/><br/>Lynx used to live in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem and should be reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park to assist in the species’ recovery. One of the most important purposes of critical habitat designation is to protect areas where species don’t currently live but have historically been found and could expand to occupy. Just because lynx may not currently call the greater Yellowstone ecosystem home doesn’t mean habitat protections should be removed from this area. Moreover, a lynx population in Yellowstone is vital for connectivity to allow gene flow between populations in Colorado and those to the north in Montana and Idaho.   <br/><br/>Additionally, I oppose the reduction of critical habitat in the Garnet Mountains, east of Missoula, Montana which provide connectivity for lynx further north to let them reach habitats in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem and the Bitterroot Mountains. The Bureau of Land Management has proposed logging almost 17,000 acres of the Garnet Mountains, which would greatly reduce their suitability for lynx. Removing critical habitat protections here would be disastrous. <br/><br/>To ensure the survival and recovery of threatened Canada lynx, the Service must expand critical habitat protections and reject any proposals to reduce existing protections.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Melissa Vasconcellos<br/>CA 93001

INFO - Comment: As a consumer, I strongly support clear, consumer-friendly GMO labels on ALL foods containing GMO ingredients.<br/><br/>The proposed rule could exclude 70 percent of foods containing GMOs by creating a loophole for GMO-derived sugars and oils. The rule should clearly encompass all ingredients derived from crops created through any form of genetic engineering, including CRISPR and RNAi.<br/><br/>All GMO foods must carry a clear and consumer-friendly GMO label. Heres why:<br/><br/>- Consumers will expect that a mandatory GMO disclosure applies to all GMO foods. They will have a false sense of security that foods without the label are GMO free.<br/>- Failure to include GMO sugars and oils would ignore Congress intent to label 25,000 more products than labeled under the state laws in Connecticut, Maine and Vermont.<br/>- According to analysis by EWG, as many as 63,000 food products could be excluded from labeling requirements if GMO-derived sugars and oils are not included.<br/>- Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., who worked on the legislation, stated that the law allows for labeling of highly refined sugars and oils.<br/>- Failure to include GMO sugars and oils, as well as all forms of genetic engineering, could create trade conflicts. Most countries that require GMO disclosures require that highly refined sugars and oils, as well as products of modern forms of biotechnology, to be labeled.<br/><br/>I urge you to create clear, consumer-friendly GMO labeling standard that requires labels on ALL GMO foods.

INFO - Comment: I support the USDA's proposal to change the process for licensing dealers, exhibitors, and others. The long-standing practice of automatically renewing licenses, regardless of whether a facility had a history of noncompliance with the Animal Welfare Act, resulted in a great deal of animal suffering. Requiring a demonstration of compliance with the law, disclosure of any violations of other laws pertaining to animal cruelty, and ensuring that licenses are not awarded to individuals whose licenses have been revoked or who are simply attempting to skirt prohibitions against the ownership of exotic pets are all steps in the right direction. <br/><br/>However, I think that three years is entirely too long for a license to be valid; that is an invitation to lax oversight. I also believe that applicants should receive two, not three, chances to demonstrate compliance with the law during pre-license inspections. Further, the USDA should not take on the additional burden of providing certain dealers and exhibitors with a temporary license, but rather ensure the department has conducted the compliance inspections necessary to issue--or reject--a new 2-year license before an existing license is set to expire.<br/><br/>I am glad to see the proposed improvements in standards regarding veterinary care and access to water for dogs. It is a welcome sign that the proposal requires that the program be signed by the veterinarian, that each adult dog receive an annual hands-on physical exam, and that there be regularly scheduled vet visits. However, the rule should also state that the veterinarian should physically examine any sick animals. I would also suggest that an upgrading in the standards of care for all animals is long overdue and should be undertaken immediately. <br/><br/>Finally, a far simpler mechanism for appealing licensing denials should be put forth. The law doesn't require a formal hearing, and going that route would merely allow violators to stay in business that much longer.<br/><br/>Thank you for this opportunity to comment upon this much-needed change in the USDA's implementation of the AWA.

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review process has made it possible to save thousands of endangered sea turtles, begin rebuilding fish depleted fish populations and protect thousands of square miles of deep sea coral formations. Please withdraw your proposed NEPA rule that would limit the quality of review and public involvement, and create a new rule that will protect ocean life.  It's NMFS' responsibility to oversee the environmental review process in the public's interest. Unfortunately, your NEPA proposal is full of new loopholes and exclusions that would limit review and hand over too much authority to fishery management councils who have a long history of poor management and that is documented. Furthermore, the proposal significantly limits the public's ability to participate in the NEPA process and hold government managers accountable.  America's marine ecosystems depend on informed management. Please create a new rule that will enable us to do a better job of protecting and restoring life in the ocean.We have a home on Jensen Beach, Florida and want to protect the beautuful life the sea turtles deserve.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Sincerely yours<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Lori, Ashley, Jerry Roraback<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Sincerely, Jerry Roraback 82 Flintlock Road 9500 S.

This proposal is a gigantic leap forward in this country’s long-delayed efforts to eliminate and reduce lead exposures among the millions of people living in residences across the country with lead-based paint, as well as the many children who attend childcare facilities where lead paint is present.  <br/><br/>You, the EPA, estimates that this rule (if finalized) would result in monetized benefits ranging from $1.1 billion to $4.7 billion per year – all from increased lifetime earnings based on improved cognitive function that will result from the implementation of this rule.  It will also have other significant benefits in avoided adverse health effects in children, including attention-related behavioral problems, reduced post-natal growth, delayed puberty, and decreased kidney function, and avoided adverse health effects in adults, including cardiovascular deaths and reproductive harm.  In other words, finalizing this rule will result in significant health and life-improvement benefits.  <br/><br/>These lead exposure issues are also an environmental justice issue. This proposed rule would reduce lead exposures for between 217,000 and 436,000 children per year. This rule will particularly benefit children in low-wealth households and Black children, who face disproportionately high exposures to lead dust from paint.  <br/><br/>I would also like to say that old hotels are sometimes painted with lead based paints. Staying in a hotel is sometimes for a week or even a month or more! <br/><br/>Given the many public health benefits of this rule, it is vital to finalize it as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Cindy Kelton<br/>Kyle, TX 78640

INFO - Comment: To Whom It May Concern: <br/><br/>I am disappointed to learn the Department of the Interior is proposing major restrictions on future natural gas and oil lease sales, and even considering ending future sales entirely. At a time when prices for everything are rising and there isn’t enough energy to meet demand, we should be opening our federal waters for responsible development - not closing them for extended periods.   <br/><br/>No new lease sales over the next 5 years, as considered in the latest DOI 5-year proposal, could be a disaster for our economy as we are trying to recover from a global energy crisis, fix our supply chains, and avoid a recession. How are families supposed to keep up if the cost of just getting to work or school keeps rising? How are small businesses or large employers alike going to hire or retain workers if it’s more expensive to keep the lights on? The government needs to take serious action to increase our energy supply - and do it quickly!  <br/><br/>We have some of the largest natural gas and oil reserves in the world right off our shores, on government-owned land, so why aren’t we using them? We know how to develop this energy responsibly. So, let’s make sure that America has a secure energy supply, so we can keep our economy going without relying on imports from overseas.  <br/><br/>For all these reasons, I ask you to support American energy by rejecting a continued pause on lease sales and committing to a reliable offshore leasing schedule that includes all of the 11 proposed sales. Offshore oil and gas leasing is crucial for our economy and national security, and we can’t afford to delay any longer.

The ESA is one of the most effective conservation laws in the world and has a 99 percent success rate at stopping extinction.<br/><br/>The eastern and western populations of the North American migratory monarch have experienced drastic declines in recent decades, driven by habitat loss and fragmentation (including overwintering habitat and milkweed and nectar plant supporting habitats), excessive pesticide use, and climate change. Despite efforts to restore monarch habitats through the planting of milkweed and nectar plants, these threats continue to outpace restoration efforts.<br/><br/>Listing the monarch butterfly as threatened would significantly improve its chances of survival, providing essential resources, coordinated action, and legal protections to mitigate the threats and enhance habitat restoration on a larger scale.<br/><br/>The migratory western monarch population, in particular, has seen a steady decline, with fewer than 2,000 individuals recorded in 2020, compared to millions in the 1980s. The eastern monarch population has also faced severe losses, including an 84% decline in 2014. According to the Species Status Assessment, the eastern monarch faces a 48-69% chance of extinction within the next 60 years, while the western monarch has a staggering 98-99% probability of extinction. These alarming statistics make clear that protecting the monarch under the Endangered Species Act is essential to prevent its extinction.<br/><br/>To ensure that future generations can witness the monarch's incredible migratory journey and the beauty of this species’ vibrant orange and black wings, we must act now to protect this beloved animal and its dwindling habitats.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Debra Haaland,<br/><br/>I am writing to you today to express my opposition to Gulf-wide leasing in the oil and gas lease sales 259 and 261. <br/><br/>The Inflation Reduction Act does not require the administration to lease the entire Western and Central Gulf. Nor does it mandate any particular results from those sales. Rather, Congress, through both the IRA and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, empowered Interior to determine the size, location, and conditions for offshore leasing sales and preserved Interior’s authority to decide whether to issue a lease. And BOEM has the obligation to make those decisions based on a full evaluation of the environmental effects that leasing will cause – including climate pollution, oil spills, and harms to the critically endangered Rice’s whale. <br/><br/>There is simply no need for BOEM to continue with the large-scale lease sales we saw for four years under the Trump administration. Oil companies currently hold close to 1,900 leases covering more than 10 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico. Only about 500 of those leases are currently in production, meeting the current demand for offshore oil and gas and leaving more than 7.4 million leased acres (or 75% of current lease holdings) remaining to be developed to meet any near or mid-term national energy needs. <br/><br/>Moreover, massive area-wide lease sales are fundamentally incompatible with the Biden administration’s commitments to fight climate change. Decisions we make now about additional leases have no effect on current or even near-term energy needs because new leases typically take a decade to produce any oil. And because of the long-term nature of oil and gas development, leasing now locks in investments in fossil fuels for decades to come, long after the time when the United States and the world must transition to a clean energy economy if we are to avoid the more catastrophic impacts of climate change.   <br/><br/>Finally, continuing with massive leases sales increases the already dire harm to Gulf wildlife – like the 50 remaining critically endangered Rice’s whale – and to Gulf communities, which have disproportionately borne the brunt of the country’s fossil fuel addiction for far too long. Locking in new leases means locking in continued harm for decades to come and will only slow the needed rapid phase-out of fossil fuel from the nation’s energy portfolio.   <br/><br/>I urge you to not sell off millions of acres of Gulf leases and to use your authority and ample discretion to instead accelerate the rapid transition to the clean energy future the country needs!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>W Gold<br/>Saugerties, NY 12477

As recently as 1960, this species numbered in the hundreds of thousands, but today only around 6,400 black rhinos survive in the wild.  <br/><br/>Black rhinos and other critically endangered species should be recovered — not shot.  <br/> <br/>Lippie and Willem, aged 28 and 31, were killed for thrills in 2022 by U.S. trophy hunters. Each hunter paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for the chance to slaughter these animals — money that should have been dedicated to recovering rhinos by addressing the threats to their existence rather than perpetuating their consumption. The United States shouldn’t be allowing any consumptive trade in this or any other endangered species. <br/> <br/>The United States should stand strong against any trade in black rhinos. These iconic animals are critically endangered due to poaching for their horns, and as "trophies” taken under the guise of sport hunting have actually been used to get horn onto the black market for sale as status symbols or for traditional medicine. Letting wealthy hunters kill endangered species by claiming it supports “conservation” sends the message that coveting rhino horn and other imperiled animal products is perfectly fine — if you have enough money. That messaging perpetuates demand.  <br/><br/>Saving rhinos requires people to value them and the role they play in their ecosystems — not the money that can be made off their deaths.  <br/><br/>Please deny the permit applications to import the trophies made from Lippie and Willem.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Margaret Cathey<br/>AZ 85297-9423

INFO - Comment: Humans may be the single greatest threat to lobo recovery, which means its in our power to end that threat. Mexican gray wolves need the maximum possible protection from illegal killings, so Im urging you to do the following:<br/><br/>INCREASE LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR WOLVES AND PUNISHMENT FOR POACHERS<br/><br/>- Policies that loosen legal protections lead to substantial increases in illegal killing. USFWS should adopt and enforce the strictest Endangered Species Act protections for Mexican gray wolves to reduce illegal killings.<br/>- USFWS not only should increase law enforcement presence but must also follow through with increased prosecution of poachers. Both investigation and enforcement must increase to send a message that illegal killing will not be tolerated. <br/>- The McKittrick Policy continues to limit the number of successful prosecutions of illegal killing of Mexican gray wolves. This policy must be overturned to ensure that Mexican wolves are protected from claims of mistaken identity that prevent justice from being served. I thought it was a coyote should never be an acceptable defense for killing an endangered wolf.   <br/>- USFWS should increase law enforcement during hunting seasons, when wolves are at greater risk of illegal killing (both intentional and accidental). <br/>- USFWS should stop providing telemetry and GPS receivers and codes for Mexican gray wolves radio collars to anyone except government biologists and scientific investigators. The present practice contributes to the exceedingly high number of illegal killings of wolves.<br/><br/>FUNDING AND STAFF CAPACITY MUST INCREASE TO REDUCE MORTALITY AND IMPROVE PUBLIC OUTREACH<br/><br/>- USFWS and cooperating agencies should be increasing their capacity to conduct community outreach to educate people about endangered Mexican gray wolves, support communities living with wolves through nonlethal conflict-avoidance projects, and fund law enforcement activities to ensure wild wolves are protected from poaching.<br/>- Current outreach activities such as the Mexican Wolf Recovery Program website, public wolf location map, public meetings or hearings, media relations, and emails are important components of an outreach program but are not enough to raise awareness about the importance of Mexican gray wolves and their protected status. Outreach efforts must expand beyond these minimal steps.<br/>- USFWS should consider the role of volunteers in helping with community outreach and build a robust volunteer program to support staff in conducting outreach in more places where wolves are returning. <br/>- USFWS is calling for reducing wolf killings through public outreach and education, protective fencing, and overpassesbut without adding a dime to make it happen. USFWS must budget to ensure the success of these programs. Conservation and wildlife nonprofits stand by as willing partners to seek additional funding.<br/>- USFWS claims it will increase law enforcement presence and investigation in over half of Arizona and New Mexico with funding that would cover salaries for fewer than two law enforcement officers! Far more law enforcement capacity must be created to ensure endangered lobos are protected wherever they may roam.<br/>- USFWS and cooperating agencies should conduct more outreach and education to hunters and outfitters (especially during hunting seasons) to reduce the risk of someone mistakenly killing a Mexican gray wolf. Mistaken identity should never be an excuse for illegally killing an endangered wolf. <br/>- USFWS and cooperating agencies often use language that implies that wolves do not belong north of I-40, potentially leading to increased intolerance and attitudes that wolves dispersing outside of the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area (MWEPA) should be killed. Messaging must change to stop the hostile environment being created for dispersing wolves. We strongly urge consideration for how outreach messaging may be inadvertently contributing to intolerance for wolves.<br/>- Cooperating agencies like the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, and Bureau of Land Management all have important roles in protecting endangered species on federal public lands. These cooperating agencies should embrace this responsibility and increase their community outreach in parallel with USFWS. <br/>- Cooperating agencies like the Arizona Game and Fish Department and the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish have important roles in protecting endangered species throughout their states. These cooperating agencies should expand their community outreach in support of Mexican gray wolf recovery, clearly communicating the intrinsic value, ecological role, and protected status of Mexican gray wolves. These agencies should be emphasizing that wolves are welcome and that illegal killing will not be tolerated.

INFO - Comment: I oppose the proposed HHS rule, Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities" (RIN 0945-AA17).  <br/><br/>Adding pregnancy termination as a pregnancy related condition under the definition of sex discrimination is offensive not only to health professionals who seek to provide lifesaving and life-giving care to all their patients, it is an attack on the dignity of women and children, born and unborn. The conscience rights of health care professionals and insurers are at stake as they should not be coerced to perform or cover abortions.   <br/><br/>Additionally, abortion is NOT healthcare, is harmful to women, and takes the life another human being. Therefore, pregnancy termination does not constitute sex discrimination and should not be covered under sex discrimination nor forced to be covered by taxpayer dollars, which a majority of Americans agree with.   <br/><br/>The provisions of the proposed rule which protect abortion is a direct violation of moral, conscience and religious objections of health care professional and tax paying Americans, and likely violates peoples religious freedoms and conscience rights protected under existing federal protections.   <br/><br/>For the reasons stated above, I oppose the abortion related provisions of the proposed rule.

INFO - Comment: As a strong supporter of wildlife and the Endangered Species Act, I urge you to abandon your three major proposed changes for implementing the Act. These proposals would drastically undermine the Act and set us in exactly the wrong direction just as the planet is experiencing a sixth mass extinction period.<br/><br/>For nearly 45 years the Endangered Species Act has served as a vital last line of defense for plants and animals on the verge of extinction. This popular law has been remarkably effective, preventing the extinction of 99 percent of the species under its care. <br/><br/>The proposed Endangered Species Act regulatory changes would undermine the Act by: <br/><br/>-Eliminating automatic protections for species listed as threatened under the Act <br/>-Allowing federal agencies to ignore the known threats to vulnerable species from climate change <br/>-Permitting habitat that is critical to the conservation of a listed species to be destroyed bit by bit<br/>-Letting federal agencies off the hook for protecting species listed under the Act as long as their actions wont speed up a species decline to extinctionthe exact opposite of the standard set in the Act itself, which seeks to ensure that federal agency actions dont undermine a species ability to survive and recover<br/><br/>I strongly urge the Trump administration to withdraw these damaging proposals.

INFO - Comment: The proposed rule carries with it a lot of statistical data demonstrating how this added responsibility will increase patient care, employment opportunities for the youth, and the potential increase in wages for this age group.  However, the proposed rule just speculates that this added duty will increase wages for 16 and 17 year-olds.  A proposed change or addition to this rule would be to require those employers who permit their young employees to operate patient lifts to pay these employees appropriately with this new job responsibility.  <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Another recommendation for this rule would be for the agency to create and implement a training program for these young employees.  This would cut training costs for employers and would directly benefit employers, employees, and the individuals being treated.  The program could issue completion certificates and employees could add this to their work portfolio for future growth opportunities.  This certificate could be placed on employee resumes as well.  A challenge many of the youth face when entering the work force is the lack of a padded resume.  By providing opportunities like a training completion certificate, this could help to bridge the disconnect with youth and school or work.<br/>

INFO - Comment: Vermilion Cliffs National Monument should be permanently maintained in the entirety of its current borders as a National Monument due to its significant geologic, historical, cultural, ecological, and economic value to local Native American tribes, the local region, the state of Arizona, and the United States.<br/><br/>Executive Order #13792 directs Secretary Zinke to consider "whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the Act as "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific interest."" The Bureau of Land Management rightly calls Vermilion Cliffs National Monument "a geologic treasure." Spanning 4,000 vertical feet of exposed geologic history, multicolored layers of shale and sandstone are visually stunning. However, President Clinton's proclamation to establish the National Monument (http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=62318) makes clear the significance of its archeological history as well: "Some of the earliest rock art in the Southwest can be found in the monument. High densities of Ancestral Puebloan sites can also be found, including remnants of large and small villages, some with intact standing walls, fieldhouses, trails, granaries, burials, and camps." The history of the area is closely tied to its landscape, such as ancient hand and footholds carved into vertical canyon walls by the ancient Pueblo people. Other important factors that informed President Clinton's decision include the history of historic expeditions in the area, unique vegetation including the endemic and threatened Welsh's milkweed, and populations of raptors, reptiles, amphibians, and large mammals. Notably, the Vermilion Cliffs are a rehabilitation area for the endangered California Condor. <br/><br/>Secretary Zinke is additionally instructed to review Monuments in part based on "concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by a designation, including the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities." The Vermilion Cliffs area is the ancestral home of the Zuni Pueblo and Hopi tribes, who value the history and culture of this land (https://www.archaeologysouthwest.org/2013/07/21/consultation/): in the words of one Zuni Pueblo elder, "Sometimes you get homesick, but here you don't. It fees normal and like you were back to where you were before. You have a sense of being. Everything is there and you can feel it. You don't have any feelings of being out of place."  <br/>Neighboring communities in Coconino County benefited significantly from the establishment of Vermilion Cliffs National Monument, with a 24% increase in jobs and a 27% increase in real personal income from 2000 to 2008. In fact, travel and tourism provided one third of all private employment in the county in 2008, supporting 15,500 jobs (https://headwaterseconomics.org/wp-content/uploads/Vermilion.pdf). The area is increasingly a hub for out-of-state tourism. Within the National Monument, a unique geologic formation called "The Wave" has gained viral popularity during the past few years, as its stunning beauty has earned a spot on the bucket lists of outdoor recreation lovers across the world. While access to The Wave is tightly controlled to preserve its features, such attractions put the surrounding area on the map for other visitors. This tourist draw is an important support for surrounding communities.<br/><br/>Secretary Zinke is further directed to consider "that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management...". President Clinton wrote in 2000 that "Full of natural splendor and a sense of solitude, this area remains remote and unspoiled, qualities that are essential to the protection of the scientific and historic objects it contains." The remote beauty, tourism potential, and archeological importance of this land would be put at risk by reducing its borders for industrial development. <br/><br/>Given the value of Vermilion Cliffs National Monument as a unique geologic and environmental spectacle, its economic benefit to the surrounding region, and its archeologic importance, I wholeheartedly support its continued and permanent protection in the entirety of its currently drawn borders. Vermilion Cliffs National Monument is an American treasure deserving of permanent protection.

INFO - Comment: As a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA), Im writing today in support of the interim final rule regarding the Authority of VA Professionals to Practice Health Care (RIN 2900-AQ94). As you know, this interim final rule would expand our veterans access to high-quality healthcare by confirming that the VA may allow healthcare professionals, including CRNAs, to deliver healthcare services in a state other than their state of licensure, registration, certification, or other state requirement, and confirming its ability to standardize healthcare professionals practice across all VA facilities nation-wide. <br/><br/>CRNAs are already the primary anesthesia providers in combat support hospitals, forward surgical teams, and the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force. Allowing VA CRNAs the ability to practice to the full scope of their education and training will help to ensure that the brave men and women that have served our country have access to this same high-quality care at VA facilities. <br/><br/>The success of this model has already been demonstrated. In April 2020, the VA issued Directive 1899, which encouraged VA medical facilities to utilize healthcare professionals, such as CRNAs, to the full scope of their license, registration, or certification in order to help increase access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, directive 1899 has helped to address staffing shortages and reduced long wait times for patients. Its time for this policy to be made official across all VA facilities. <br/><br/>Numerous studies by independent arbiters, including the RAND Corporation, Lewin Group, National Academy of Medicine, and others, have also demonstrated that there is no difference in the quality of care provided by a CRNA or their physician counterpart, and that CRNAs practicing independently is the most cost-effective method of anesthesia delivery. <br/><br/>This is the right thing to do for our nations veterans and I stand in strong support of this interim final rule.

INFO - Comment: I am an osteopathic physician and strongly oppose the inclusion of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) CPT codes 98925-98929 in revisions to payment policies under the Physician Fee Schedule. <br/><br/>CPT codes 98925-98929 should be excluded from the list of 83 codes because the CPT codes for OMT do not meet CMS' criteria for inclusion in the proposed rule. RUC rationale supports that an E/M is typically reported with this service, and the RUC accounted for this in its valuation.<br/><br/>In 2010, the AMA RUC requested that the AOA survey the OMT codes to develop accurate and unbiased information for the relative value of the physician work involved in performing OMT as part of the CMS fourth five-year review of RBRVS.<br/><br/>The survey process required the creation of vignettes to describe the typical patient for CPT Codes 98925-98929.  Following the RUC survey of the OMT codes during the fourth five-year review of the RBRVS, CMS acknowledged in the 2011 Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule the differences between E/M services and OMT, and the possible overlap in the work of E/M and OMT services. After reviewing the RUC recommendations for physician work and time, CMS reduced the pre- and post- service times to reflect only the time required to perform the work associated with the OMT service and to exclude any time that could be associated with an E/M service. This adjustment clearly recognizes the payment for OMT only consists of the work required to perform the OMT service: <br/><br/>Specifically, the Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 228/Monday, November 28, 2011/Rules and Regulation, Page 73158 states "We continue to believe that some of the activities in the pre- and post-service times of the osteopathic manipulative treatment codes and the E/M visit overlap, and that our proposal to remove 1 minute of pre- and 1 minute of post-service time appropriately accounts for this overlap. As detailed earlier in section III.A. of this final rule with comment period, we do not believe the overlap in activities should be counted in developing these procedures' work values. In order to ensure consistent and appropriate valuation of physician work, we are continuing with the application of our methodology, explained in the Fourth Five-Year Review (76 FR 32422), to address the overlapping activities when a service is typically billed on the same day as an E/M service."<br/><br/>As such, the CPT codes for OMT do not meet the CMS' criteria for inclusion in the proposed rule and should be removed from the screen.

But loopholes in the system—like the ones that allow unlicensed gun sellers to sell guns online and at gun shows without running background checks on their buyers—undermine it.<br/><br/>That’s why ATF’s proposed rule is so important and should be finalized. It will help close loopholes in our background check system that have, for decades, been exploited by bad actors like gun traffickers, straw purchasers, and other prohibited persons, including domestic abusers and convicted felons.<br/><br/>I support the proposed rule because it makes clear that firearms dealing can take place wherever and through whatever medium guns are bought and sold—whether that’s at a gun show or an online marketplace—and that certain conduct, like selling guns of the same or similar kind and type, constitutes firearms dealing. That means that these gun sellers will need to become licensed dealers and, as licensed dealers, run background checks.<br/><br/>The proposed rule won't just expand background checks and strengthen our background check system, but it will also save lives. That’s why I support the proposed rule and why I encourage ATF to finalize it.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Kevin O'Brien

INFO - Comment: I applaud the Service's proposed rule to revise critical habitat designations for Florida manatees and to designate critical habitat for Antillean manatees in Puerto Rico. I urge the Service to finalize these designations in a timely manner and in accordance with the mandates of the Endangered Species Act. <br/><br/>While I’m supportive of this proposal, the Service must designate additional areas known to be critical to the recovery of the species.  <br/><br/>For one thing, the arbitrary limitation of the critical habitat to within 30 kilometers of winter manatee aggregation areas contradicts the best available science regarding manatee movement and excludes the Upper Mosquito Lagoon. This waterway is undoubtedly critical to the continued survival of Florida manatees and has provided much needed forage to mitigate deaths during the ongoing unusual mortality event.  <br/><br/>The Service is well aware of the importance of the Upper Mosquito Lagoon to the species and should include it as critical habitat in the final designation. Adjusting the criteria to include foraging areas within 50 kilometers of the identified warm-water refuges as physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the species would accomplish this goal. <br/><br/>Additionally, the Service should include Florida Power & Light's warm-water outfalls as critical habitat for the species. While I support Florida Power & Light's "Net Zero by 2045" goal, this created habitat is relied upon heavily by Florida manatees in winter months, as recognized by the Service's Florida Manatee Warm-Water Habitat Action Plan. It’s critical to work with Florida Power & Light to establish a schedule by which the company’s plants will no longer regularly utilize the outfalls, helping the agency and organizations better transition the species back to natural sources. <br/><br/>Finally, the entirety of the Ocklawaha and St. Johns Rivers should be included as critical habitat. These rivers are major travel corridors for the species and provide access to several natural warm-water sites. <br/><br/>Again, I thank the Service for taking the first step to protect Florida manatees’ habitat. I urge you expand the proposed protections in the final designation.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Lavonna Patterson<br/>CA 95838

This would be devastating for a region that produces more than 15% of America's oil. One estimation determined a 5-year lapse in lease could mean 885,000 fewer barrels of oil per day by 2036. If we think the cost of energy is bad now, I can only imagine what it would be if we fell even further behind in domestic production.<br><br><br/><br/>The Department of the Interior is charged with responsibly managing our public lands and waters. This means balancing environmental protection and resource development. Fortunately, the oil and natural gas produced in the Gulf of Mexico has some of the lowest carbon-intensity in the world. Not to mention, U.S. environmental standards are far superior to many oil-producing regions in the world.<br><br><br/><br/>You have the opportunity to increase American energy production at a time in which we desperately need it - and do it responsibly.

INFO - Comment: To My senators and congressmen and anyone else to whom it may concern :<br/><br/>Today I write in strong support of the proposed rule titled: Compliance With Statutory Program Integrity Requirements (HHS-OS-2018-0008), also known as the Protect Life Rule.<br/><br/>The proposed rule seeks to reinstate Reagan-era prohibitions on Title X funding for abortion centers. Similar regulations were upheld by the Supreme Court in 1991 in Rust v. Sullivan (500 U.S. 173).<br/><br/>Abortion is not family planning. This rule would draw a bright line between abortion and family planning, as was clearly intended in the statute.<br/><br/>Currently 266 Planned Parenthood abortion centers are also federal Title X locations. Planned Parenthood is the nations largest abortion business and receives $50-$60 million a year from Title X. They should not be entitled to treat Title X as their personal slush fund. Research released by the Charlotte Lozier Institute in 2018 shows Planned Parenthood has inflated the U.S. abortion rate, controlling more than 35% of the abortion industry and resulting in more than three million extra abortions that could have been avoided.<br/><br/>American taxpayers do not want to be complicit in abortions through their taxpayer dollars. According to a January 2018 Marist poll, six in ten Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion. Money is fungible and tax dollars should be invested in comprehensive health care alternatives, not used as a slush fund to prop up the abortion industry.<br/><br/>It's important to note that the proposed rule will not reduce family planning funding by a single dollar. This rule would simply direct taxpayer funds to family planning providers who stay out of the abortion business. Women and girls are best served at alternative health care centers including community and rural health care centers that outnumber Planned Parenthood abortion facilities by more than 20 to 1 nationwide.<br/><br/>I strongly urge adoption of the rule.<br/>  Life is not a joke. It is not something to take lightly. Life is precious . We must strive to protect It ! <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Ellen Concannon<br/>New Jersey

INFO - Comment: The proposed rule is contrary to well-established United States law regarding the right to seek asylum in our country. Individuals should be able to access our asylum system regardless of how they enter, as has been the law for decades. They should not be forced to seek asylum in transit to the United States, especially not in countries where they may also face harm. The ending of Title 42—itself an illegal policy—should not be used as an excuse to resurrect Trump-era categorical bans on groups of asylum seekers.<br/><br/>The rule will also cause confusion at ports of entry and cause chaos and exacerbate backlogs in our immigration courts. People who cannot access the CBP One app are at serious risk of being turned away by CBP, even if the rule says otherwise. Additionally, as was demonstrated by the previous Trump Transit Ban, the rule is likely to create confusion and additional backlogs at the immigration courts as individual judges attempt to apply a complicated, convoluted rule.

The nutrition standards implemented through the bipartisan Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act were designed to support good health and curb childhood obesity by closely aligning with the science-based Dietary Guidelines for Americans.<br/><br/>And they have been successful, increasing the healthfulness of school meals by as much as 44 percent since their implementation, according to a report from your own US Department of Agriculture.<br/><br/>Your proposed rule change would put that progress at risk. By weakening standardsfor example, allowing potatoes to qualify as fruit and certain pastas to count as vegetablesyour rule would make it less likely that kids will eat enough of the fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods they need to stay healthy.

Instead, it should maintain the ban and institute a ban on baiting black bears. <br/>  The new rule should not weaken trapping regulations. Instead, it should end all trapping on the Refuge.<br/>  The new rule should not expand the areas where snowmobiles, bikes, and ATVs are allowed. The rule should instead maintain habitat security for wildlife and improve security where it is currently compromised. The rule should also maintain the ban on the use of game carts. <br/>  Bears and other native predators are an integral part of what makes the Kenai NWR wild. Their numbers should be allowed to achieve their natural abundance and distribution, not persecuted to elevate moose or other ungulate populations.<br/>  The proposed rule makes a mockery of the area's importance as a refuge for wildlife and has no place in wildlife management on the Kenai NWR or in the Kenai Wilderness. FWS instead needs to administer the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge for the conservation purposes for which it was established.<br/><br/>Please fulfill FWS's responsibility to protect wildlife and Wilderness on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.

INFO - Comment: I am writing to express my disappointment with the USDAs decision to modify the sodium, whole grains, and milk standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. I oppose the changes and urge you to reconsider your decision. Our children need healthy, nutritious foods at school  and these changes are a significant step in the wrong direction, jeopardizing their health, well-being, and academic success.<br/><br/>I am very concerned that the changes will allow schools to serve meals with excess sodium. Children currently eat too much sodium, which can lead to negative health effects, such as elevated or high blood pressure, and an increased risk of developing heart disease at an earlier age. <br/><br/>I am also concerned that the changes will allow schools to serve fewer whole grains. Whole grains provide nutrients and are a healthful source of fiber. <br/><br/>Eating whole grains and fiber is associated with increased diet quality and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, and some studies show that eating them can lower body weight as well. We should be encouraging kids to eat more whole grains  not less.<br/><br/>In addition, allowing schools to serve 1% flavored milk contradicts many expert recommendations and increases the number of calories children consume. <br/><br/>These changes to the standards not only have negative health effects, but they are also unnecessary. More than 99% of participating schools are already meeting the strong, science-based nutrition standards the Department adopted in 2012. Rather than weakening these standards, USDA should focus on helping those schools that need extra assistance to cross the finish line. For example, USDA should work with schools to ensure that they have the education, training, and equipment necessary to prepare nutritious meals that meet the requirements. <br/><br/>Healthier children are more likely to become healthier adults. By 2025, the current healthy nutrition standards are estimated to decrease the number of childhood obesity cases by more than two million and lead to a cost savings of $800 million. With our kids developing high blood pressure, diabetes, and other chronic conditions, keeping school nutrition standards strong is more important than ever. <br/><br/>I encourage you to put children first and maintain the 2012 nutrition standards for sodium, whole grains, and milk.

Unfortunately, the revised rule caters to the interests of predatory colleges offering programs with poor outcomes and will result in hundreds of thousands more students falling victim to programs that leave them underemployed and buried in debt.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>First, the rule eliminates the gainful employment regulations entirely. These regulations protected students by terminating student aid eligibility for career training programs that would leave their graduates with too much debt relative to their earnings. It does not offer any alternative to hold colleges accountable when they fail to serve students well. In effect, more students will face financial hardship while colleges offering low-value programs continue to pad their pockets with taxpayer money. <br/> <br/>Second, the rule eliminates disclosures that required colleges to warn students at risk of attending a program that could result in high debt and low job prospects or earnings. The Department instead proposes to publish student outcomes information in the College Scorecard, but this places the burden on students to know the information exists and where to find it. It is not an adequate replacement for warnings to students.<br/><br/>Third, the new rule doesnt just harm students, it costs taxpayers too--to the tune of $5.3 billion over 10 years.<br/><br/>The proposed rule fails to serve the students whom the department is meant to protect and allows low-value programs to continue to evade responsibility while receiving billions taxpayer money as their graduates suffer.

INFO - Comment: I am writing to express concern at the FDA’s approach to allowing food companies to ignore small amounts of allergen contamination when designing food safety programs to address allergen risks. The FDA’s recent guidance entitled “Chapter 11: Food Allergy Program of the Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food: Draft Guidance for Industry,” suggests that companies can use such “thresholds” in designing preventive controls to protect against allergen cross-contamination. However, the FDA leaves it up to food companies to decide what these thresholds might be and how to ensure that consumers are not put at too much risk by the contamination. <br/><br/>Approximately one in 10 U.S. customers are affected by food allergies, and more should be done to allow them to protect themselves when they make food purchasing decisions. To do this, consumers need clear information about cross-contamination risks, such as reliable and consistent “may contain” statements on food labels. The FDA should also prevent companies from adding allergens to their foods as a response to allergen contamination risks. (Some companies do this because it’s easier to add allergens to everything rather than ensure that cross-contamination does not occur between products).  <br/><br/>I urge the FDA to retract its discussion of thresholds in this guidance. Instead, the FDA should create a comprehensive approach to cross-contact risks, that includes providing guidance that clearly defines accepted precautionary allergen labeling and bans the intentional addition of allergens to skirt food safety requirements.    <br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>K.

Building on the historic progress of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, this rule proposes limiting added sugars in school meals for the very first time. School meals that are limited in added sugars and sodium and contain whole grains can help introduce healthy eating habits and can help mitigate chronic health conditions.<br/><br/>Added Sugars: School breakfasts are far too sugary, and I applaud the USDA’s proposed cap of no more than 10 percent of calories from added sugars, which mirrors the Dietary Guidelines recommendation. I also support USDA’s product-specific added sugars limits.  <br/><br/>Sodium: While these sodium reduction goals represent progress, the final limits do not go far enough and are out of alignment with the Dietary Guidelines’ quantitative recommendations. For instance, children up to age 8 will get 83 percent of their daily recommended sodium limit from breakfast and lunch combined, leaving just 17 percent leftover for snacks and dinner. A 13-year-old will get 77 percent of their daily limit from school breakfast and lunch, and high school students will get 63 percent.<br/><br/>Whole Grains: The two options proposed by the USDA require less than half of grains offered be whole, which is not aligned with the Dietary Guidelines’ recommendations. I encourage the USDA to strengthen the whole grain-rich requirement.<br/><br/>Healthy, wholesome meals provide children the nutrients they need to grow, develop and learn in and out of the classroom, and the 30 million kids who rely on school meals every day deserve better. It’s time to stop appeasing industry and put the health of kids first.<br/><br/>THIS IS FOR OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS, HEALTH, , SAFETY & HOPE. <br/><br/>THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION IN THIS MATTER. <br/><br/>JIM.

INFO - Comment: Thank you for rejecting the state petitions to delist grizzly bears from Endangered Species Act protections. The current science shows that the best way for the species to truly recover is to maintain federal protections under the ESA and manage the bears in a way that allows for natural connectivity between their existing habitats. The science shows that a unified population of grizzly bears is essential for their long-term recovery in the Northern Rockies.  <br/><br/>Even with federal protections, last year was the deadliest year for grizzly bears in the Northern Rockies. Bears were killed during surprise encounters with hunters or were exterminated over encounters with livestock or after rummaging through unsecured household trash. Others were hit by cars or trains. Some were electrocuted. A mother bear and two cubs drowned in a concrete drainage ditch. Still more were killed at the hands of poachers. <br/><br/>At least 90 grizzly bear deaths in the Northern Rockies last year were attributable to human causes. <br/><br/>The rising trend in grizzly bear deaths is largely due to the states adopting lethal anti-science policies that allow for the killing and “take” of more bears. Now the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is considering expanding on some of these types of regressive policies, even allowing for trophy hunting of grizzly bears. Virtually all leading grizzly bear biologists say this is counterproductive to the long-term recovery of grizzly bears on the landscape.  <br/><br/>Former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Grizzly Bear coordinator Dr. Christopher Servheen’s 2024 report (https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-12-11-usfws-grizzly-petition_with-exhibits.pdf) highlights the importance of fostering natural connectivity for grizzly bears between existing recovery areas. Grizzlies also need enhanced protections against lethal human activities, careful mortality management, and more resources and assistance to communities to reduce human/bear conflicts. <br/><br/>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service should reject any policy that allows for increased human-caused mortality risks like hunting of grizzly bears, or trapping other species, like wolves and coyotes in grizzly habitats.  <br/><br/> I urge the Service to follow the best available science and pass a 4(d) rule that promotes natural connectivity of grizzly bear populations, manages grizzlies as a unified metapopulation, and reduces human-caused threats and risks to their mortality.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Gary W Kelly<br/>Bothell, WA

INFO - Comment: As a supporter of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers and our wild public lands, waters and wildlife, I am very concerned with the rule-making process announced in Federal Register Document Number 2018-18937. I am writing these comments to strongly encourage you to maintain Roadless Area protections for the Tongass and all of America's national forests. These public lands and waters are prized by sportsmen and women and are a mainstay of Alaska's economy. Nationally they help drive an $887 billion economic engine from outdoor recreation like hunting and fishing. <br/><br/>At nearly 17 million acres, the Tongass is the nation's largest national forest and the world's largest remaining intact coastal temperate rainforest. Of that wild backcountry, 9.3 million acres are inventoried roadless areas providing high quality habitat for a unique diversity of sought-after game species, including mountain goats, black-tailed deer and both brown and black bears. The Tongass also encompasses thousands of miles of salmon-rich waterways, legendary among anglers and fundamental to the state's commercial salmon industry. The commercial fishing sector alone relies on the Tongass for more than 80 percent of its salmon and employs more than 4,300 people in the region, accounting for 9 percent of the area's entire employment. By contrast, timber production accounts for only 1 percent of the region's jobs.<br/><br/>If done poorly, a state rule-making process could set a slippery precedent that unravels Roadless Rule protections for fish and wildlife across all of our nation's wild roadless forest lands including the Chugach National Forest just to the north and west. If any state rule-making process does move forward, the 2001 Roadless Rule should be the benchmark for improvements so that roadless policies only enhance the most important fish and wildlife habitats while preventing new development, road building and resource extraction.<br/><br/>Currently, these valuable resources are upheld by the Roadless Area Conservation Rule, a collaborative management approach adopted following one of the most extensive public engagement campaigns in the history of federal rulemaking. I implore you to maintain the integrity of what may be America's best and most popular land management rule in history. The costs to American taxpayers for road building and unconscionably subsidized resource extraction are too high, not to mention the irreparable impact to wildlife, water and outdoor traditions like hunting and fishing.

INFO - Comment: Dear U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,<br/><br/>Thank you for undoing some of the Trump administration's damage to critical Endangered Species Act regulations. I am heartened by many aspects of your proposed restoration.<br/><br/>However, there are multiple aspects of your proposed rules that are insufficient for the challenges that endangered wildlife are facing.<br/><br/>First, you must go back to the drawing board and fully restore section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, which governs interagency consultation. For 50 years it's been established that the federal government should not engage in activities that could jeopardize species'; survival or destroy habitat they need to survive and recover.<br/><br/>Specifically, the Biden administration must rescind the addition of &quot;as a whole&quot; to section 402.02. This Trump-era language created an enormous loophole, inconsistent with the intent of the Endangered Species Act itself. The nefarious &quot;as a whole&quot; language is a free pass to destroy critical habitat as long as the total destruction of a species' entire critical habitat is avoided. This is especially damaging for wide-ranging and migratory species, from piping plover to marbled murrelet, from salmon to lynx. This language also ignores the cumulative impact of different causes of habitat destruction over time. And it goes against the science-based establishment of critical habitat to ensure both the species survival and recovery, instead treating some areas of critical habitat as expendable.<br/><br/>Additional definition changes from the Trump era that need to be reversed include one that creates unnecessary confusion when examining an agency action that is ongoing, or a continuation of past activities as opposed to something new (&quot;environmental baseline&quot; section 402.02).<br/><br/>Additionally, you must reverse Trump's damaging changes in section 424.11(e) that allow plants and animals to be prematurely delisted. It is essential that species recovery meets all science-based standards before removing the backstop of Endangered Species Act protections that have kept so many species alive.<br/><br/>Each of the many changes to Endangered Species Act regulations made by the Trump administration weakened protections for threatened and endangered species at a time when we must be doing everything in our power to fight the biodiversity crisis and recover species from the brink of extinction. Despite the broad support for restoring and strengthening the rules that implement the Act, you've left multiple loopholes from the Trump-era rollbacks in place, which will undoubtedly jeopardize future efforts to protect wildlife and habitat. By failing to fully restore the Endangered Species Act rules, you've left a significant job.<br/><br/>_COMMENT1_<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms elizabeth jamison<br/>9608 Horton Rd  Keithville, LA 71047-8618

INFO - Title: Comment from Kopczynski, Jennifer
INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Debra Haaland,<br/><br/>I am writing to you today to express my opposition to Gulf-wide leasing in the oil and gas lease sales 259 and 261. <br/><br/>The Inflation Reduction Act does not require the administration to lease the entire Western and Central Gulf. Nor does it mandate any particular results from those sales. Rather, Congress, through both the IRA and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, empowered Interior to determine the size, location, and conditions for offshore leasing sales and preserved Interior’s authority to decide whether to issue a lease. And BOEM has the obligation to make those decisions based on a full evaluation of the environmental effects that leasing will cause – including climate pollution, oil spills, and harms to the critically endangered Rice’s whale. <br/><br/>There is simply no need for BOEM to continue with the large-scale lease sales we saw for four years under the Trump administration. Oil companies currently hold close to 1,900 leases covering more than 10 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico. Only about 500 of those leases are currently in production, meeting the current demand for offshore oil and gas and leaving more than 7.4 million leased acres (or 75% of current lease holdings) remaining to be developed to meet any near or mid-term national energy needs. <br/><br/>Moreover, massive area-wide lease sales are fundamentally incompatible with the Biden administration’s commitments to fight climate change. Decisions we make now about additional leases have no effect on current or even near-term energy needs because new leases typically take a decade to produce any oil. And because of the long-term nature of oil and gas development, leasing now locks in investments in fossil fuels for decades to come, long after the time when the United States and the world must transition to a clean energy economy if we are to avoid the more catastrophic impacts of climate change.   <br/><br/>Finally, continuing with massive leases sales increases the already dire harm to Gulf wildlife – like the 50 remaining critically endangered Rice’s whale – and to Gulf communities, which have disproportionately borne the brunt of the country’s fossil fuel addiction for far too long. Locking in new leases means locking in continued harm for decades to come and will only slow the needed rapid phase-out of fossil fuel from the nation’s energy portfolio.   <br/><br/>I urge you to not sell off millions of acres of Gulf leases and to use your authority and ample discretion to instead accelerate the rapid transition to the clean energy future the country needs!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jennifer Kopczynski<br/>Camarillo, CA 93010

INFO - Title: Comment from Painter, Sandrea
INFO - Comment: Do not approve Bayer’s petition for the nonregulated status of MON-87429 corn.<br/><br/>MON-87429 corn is designed as a pesticide delivery system. Due to herbicide-tolerant GMO crops’ reliance on their associated herbicides, it is illogical to separate the GMO crops from the herbicides. No GMO farmer would buy the premium-priced seeds without buying and using the herbicides. Therefore, the GMO crops and herbicides need to be considered as an inseparable system.<br/><br/>Since the introduction of Monsanto’s glyphosate-tolerant GMOs in the 1990s, we have seen the use of this genotoxic carcinogen increase by hundreds of millions of pounds across the U.S.<br/><br/>Since 2016, year after year we have seen that use of Bayer’s dicamba-tolerant GMOs has caused massive destruction across the country. Dicamba drift has decimated millions of acres of non-dicamba-tolerant crops, including non-GMO and organic crops, orchards, and vineyards, and has killed off pollinator-important plants, private gardens, and valuable trees across the country.<br/><br/>In June 2020, the San Francisco Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the EPA to vacate their unlawful approval of dicamba-based herbicides manufactured by Bayer and BASF. And again this year, the U.S. District Court of Arizona determined that the EPA unlawfully approved dicamba for use on dicamba-tolerant soybeans and cotton.<br/><br/>The fact that dicamba’s registration has been vacated by the courts means that USDA’s approval of MON-87429 corn would encourage GMO farmers to use dicamba illegally, as they have done before. The USDA could, itself, violate the law and subject the agency to lawsuits that taxpayers will be on the hook for.<br/><br/>Additionally, 2,4-D is also known to be drift-prone and will likely cause further damage as its usage increases with the adoption of MON-87429.<br/><br/>And if that’s not enough, a study found that glyphosate, dicamba and glufosinate, three of the herbicides that will be sprayed on MON-87429 corn, change the genetic composition of soil microbiomes, potentially contributing to the global antimicrobial resistance problem in agricultural environments.<br/><br/>The individual pesticides are linked to cancer, endocrine disruption, kidney and liver damage, autism, birth defects, reproductive problems, developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity and widespread environmental harms.<br/><br/>What's more, the EPA pesticide approval process is critically flawed. There is no assessment of the combined toxicity of pesticide mixtures on human health, the soil microbiome, on pollinators, wildlife, birds, biodiversity, or endangered species. A study found that pesticide mixtures are more toxic than the individual pesticides. This study of laboratory animals exposed to low concentrations of pesticides revealed metabolic effects on the gut-liver axis, which can potentially be used as biomarkers for the prediction of future negative health outcomes. The study found adverse impacts of the mixture on the host-gut microbiome. The risks of pesticide mixtures must be investigated before considering the approval of MON-8429 GMO corn.<br/><br/>It would be unconscionable for USDA to allow Bayer-Monsanto’s MON-87429 corn to be grown in the U.S. given everything we know about GMO contamination of non-GMO and organic crops, the damage that herbicide drift causes, and the rising toll of pesticides on human and environmental health. Growing crops genetically engineered to tolerate five different toxic herbicides is madness and USDA must put a stop to this now.

Building on the historic progress of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, this rule proposes limiting added sugars in school meals for the very first time. School meals that are limited in added sugars and sodium and contain whole grains can help introduce healthy eating habits and can help mitigate chronic health conditions.<br/><br/>Added Sugars: School breakfasts are far too sugary, and I applaud the USDA’s proposed cap of no more than 10 percent of calories from added sugars, which mirrors the Dietary Guidelines recommendation. I also support USDA’s product-specific added sugars limits.  <br/><br/>Sodium: While these sodium reduction goals represent progress, the final limits do not go far enough and are out of alignment with the Dietary Guidelines’ quantitative recommendations. For instance, children up to age 8 will get 83 percent of their daily recommended sodium limit from breakfast and lunch combined, leaving just 17 percent leftover for snacks and dinner. A 13-year-old will get 77 percent of their daily limit from school breakfast and lunch, and high school students will get 63 percent.<br/><br/>Whole Grains: The two options proposed by the USDA require less than half of grains offered be whole, which is not aligned with the Dietary Guidelines’ recommendations. I encourage the USDA to strengthen the whole grain-rich requirement.<br/><br/>Healthy, wholesome meals provide children the nutrients they need to grow, develop and learn in and out of the classroom, and the 30 million kids who rely on school meals every day deserve better.

INFO - Comment: Commenting from the perspective of a photographer, adjunct professor and founder of a workshop dedicated to freelance business practices (the course has been held nationwide & hosted by NPPA and ASMP, both leading organizations among photojournalists), I can emphatically state that photographers are already overburdened by the many hurdles in effect currently. <br/><br/>I hear from photographers in my classroom at California State University, Northridge and from photographers nationwide that the overcomplicated process and heavy fee structure are the two reasons photographers avoid registering their work. To know propose a near DOUBLING of registration fees on Groups of Published Photographs and Groups of Unpublished Photographs will serve only to seriously reduce registrations. I can assure you of that. <br/><br/>My work has been infringed upon at levels that would have been unheard of 15 years ago. I spend considerable time and effort trying to protect my registered photographs from infringers who range from representatives of congress to far right wing websites. I take the protection of my work VERY seriously as infringement erodes my ability to earn licensing fees necessary to sustain a career. <br/><br/>The US Bureau of Labor Statistics has cited the fact that freelance photographers (as opposed to staff employees) are by far the majority in today's profession and expected to grow in the era of the gig economy. This is important to note because the transfer of expenses necessary to engage in the profession from an employer to a freelancer is massive enough already. Camera gear, insurance, computers, drives, distribution platforms, software etc all are heavy burdens on a professional photographer at a time when wages are severely depressed. Having done the research for my workshop, I can provide ample proof that the wages paid by many news organizations to freelance photographers are BELOW what they were paying in 2000 when inflation is factored in. <br/><br/>The cost of registration is a key deterrent to registration. The office has already instituted recent changes limiting the number of photographs and creating, in their own words, a more streamlined and efficient registration process. The increased efficiency by the Copyright Office should result in lower fees, not higher. That's what efficiency in the overall workplace is designed to do! Suffice it to say that the end result if this increase goes through will be far fewer registrations at a time when infringement is absolutely out of control. Please reconsider the increase. <br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Todd Bigelow

INFO - Comment: I have been committed to the home health care industry for almost 40 years. The collective impact of the changes that are being proposed will destroy thousands of small business across the country who have been dedicated to providing high quality home health services to our valued seniors. As an example the Request for Anticipated Payment (RAP) has financed the quality care that has been provided to the Greatest Generation. Many small HHAs like mine depend on RAPs because of the time it takes to bill final claims as well as paying field staff for services rendered. I have heard that there is a significant percentage of home health agencies across the country that do not bill the rap till late in the episode or even before the final claim. I am sure if you looked more closely you would see that those agencies have broken processes and are not running efficiently. They might be providing quality care but you could argue that they are sloppy and lax in their billing and processing of claims. Please do not penalize honest hardworking providers just because some agencies are able to limp along without the RAP. I must also point out that physicians continue to be a major factor in delaying the billing and payment of final claims. It is not a priority for them and they simply do not care. In addition, the level of chart review and inspection (QA) has created an even greater expense for small agencies because of the new Conditions for Participation. One of two full time equivalents (FTEs) had to be hired in order to ensure compliance where in the past the Director of Nursing could QA patient records in preparation to bill final claims. Many of the proposed changes disproportionality hurt the smaller agencies and those are the vary agencies that take any patient that is referred to them. Many of the larger organizations are far more selective in the type of referrals they desire and accept. These changes will undoubtably drive many providers out of business but will that truly accomplish what you desire? Will it serve the needs of seniors if the home care agencies that remain are not as committed to serving all patients.<br/>So please reconsider the new payment options you are proposing and think about what type of agencies will be able to survive this upheaval. It may not be who you really want or need to meet the huge demand of care in the near future.<br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Drake R.

It’s a shame, to me, that we’ve destroyed so much of our native wetlands, and we’ve seen agricultural and natural disaster (particularly flooding) impacts from it. <br/><br/>We’re a people in love with loopholes and litigation—ultimately I want our laws to establish clear, no nonsense boundary lines to prevent human greed from subsuming human and environmental needs.

They shouldn’t only be covered as lookalike animals. These giraffes occupy small portions of their historic ranges, and while their populations have increased since the 1970s, those populations pale in comparison to historic sizes. Given these population dynamics and the threats giraffes face — especially from a growing human population, habitat loss, and climate change, which will reduce connectivity and resiliency of remaining giraffe populations — southern giraffes should be listed in their own right.  <br/><br/>Giraffes have been suffering what scientists call a silent extinction.

INFO - Comment: Protection of these iconic butterflies is desperately needed, less they go extinct - there diminishing numbers are alarming. Do the right thing!<br/><br/>Thank you for your efforts to protect monarch butterflies. I strongly encourage you to list the monarch butterfly under the Endangered Species Act.  <br/><br/>Decades of science is clear:  without additional safeguards, monarch populations are facing a very real threat of extinction. Protection for these beloved butterflies is clearly warranted because of ongoing and growing threats from climate change, pesticides, insecticides and loss of habitat due to logging, and other large scale industrial and agricultural development.<br/><br/>The monarch butterfly is an American treasure. Please make sure these orange-and-black beauties survive for future generations by listing the monarch butterfly under the Endangered Species Act.

Carnivores are vital for healthy and balanced ecosystems. This proposed rule recognizes that as scores of species become increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and other threats, protecting biodiversity is necessary for a healthy environment.<br/><br/>Please finalize this rule to safeguard native carnivores on national wildlife refuges.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mary Grindeland<br/>CA 94089

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar,<br/><br/>The mission of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to put the health and well-being of the public first. But instead of working to ensure everyone has equal access to comprehensive and nondiscriminatory services, this proposed rule would expand the ability of institutions and entities, including hospitals, pharmacies, doctors, nurses, even receptionists, to use their religious or moral beliefs to discriminate and deny patients health care.<br/><br/>Patients should not have to fear a provider will turn them away due to religious or moral beliefs and no doctor should be forced to withhold information or provide substandard care to a patient because of hospital executives' beliefs.<br/>Yet, hospitals use religious beliefs to refuse to treat a woman seeking abortion, even when it is the standard of care; pharmacies cite religion to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions, and providers refuse to treat LGBTQ individuals simply because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. When these refusals happen, patients suffer harmful health consequences. The harms caused by refusals to provide care have a disproportionate impact on those who already face multiple barriers to care, including communities of color, LGBTQ individuals, people facing language barriers, and those struggling to make ends meet.<br/>HHS should not be looking for ways to embolden providers to discriminate against patients. Instead, HHS should follow its mission and commit to protect individuals' health and well-being and seek ways to address the real discrimination that women, LGBTQ people, and others face every day.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Barbara Crocker<br/>  Vero Beach, FL 32963

INFO - Comment: As someone greatly concerned about the protection of marine ecosystems,<br/>I am writing to comment on the Draft Proposed 2010-2015 Outer<br/>Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program.<br/><br/>I urge you to remove from the 5-year plan any new leasing in the<br/>Beaufort and Chukchi seas. The ocean and coastal ecosystems of the<br/>Beaufort and Chukchi are home to walruses, seals and endangered whales,<br/>and serve as staging and molting grounds for hundreds of thousands of<br/>migratory birds. They are also integral to the livelihoods and cultures<br/>of Native communities across northern Alaska.<br/><br/>Energy development should not be allowed in the Beaufort and Chukchi<br/>seas until a comprehensive plan has been prepared based on a full<br/>scientific assessment of the health, biodiversity, and functioning of<br/>these arctic ecosystems. Arctic waters are particularly sensitive<br/>marine ecosystems and there is no proven technology to contain oil<br/>spills in the arctic ice environment. The U.S. government's own expert<br/>agency, the National Marine Fisheries Service, has concluded that there<br/>are not enough safeguards or data to go forward with drilling in the<br/>Arctic, and has recommended against it.<br/><br/>I also urge you to exclude Bristol Bay, one of our nation's richest<br/>fishing grounds, from the 5-year plan. Fifteen cetacean species<br/>including the imperiled bowhead, blue, fin, sei, humpback and sperm<br/>whales  occur in Bristol Bay, a spectacularly rich area for marine<br/>life. One of the planned lease sale areas overlaps with critical<br/>habitat designated for the eastern North Pacific right whale, the most<br/>endangered whale population in the world.<br/><br/>There are many strong reasons to stop and reassess energy development<br/>off the coast of Alaska. Scientific evidence shows that climate change<br/>is causing severe changes in Alaska's arctic and subarctic waters,<br/>resulting in loss of habitat for polar bears, walruses and seals, and<br/>undermining our ability to predict cumulative environmental impacts<br/>from oil and gas development. High winds and powerful seas, variable<br/>ice and cold temperatures challenge offshore technologies, and there is<br/>presently no proven method for oil spill cleanup in ice-laden waters.<br/>In addition, little is known about the population, distribution, and<br/>behavior of many species in these waters.<br/><br/>Alaska's marine and coastal regions constitute an unrivaled ocean<br/>legacy. We cannot afford to place them at risk. Thank you for the<br/>opportunity to comment on the 5-year plan.<br/>

Yet these proposed rules would make schools more dangerous for all students. Schools would be allowedand, in many cases, requiredto ignore students who report sexual harassment. In many instances, schools would not be responsible for addressing sexual harassment, even when school employees knew about the harassment. Schools would be required to ignore harassment that happens outside of school activities or off school grounds, even if the victim has to see their harasser(s) in class every day, and would be required to ignore all harassment on school grounds until it becomes so severe that it costs students important learning opportunities. <br/> <br/>And in the rare cases when schools would be required to respond, they would be allowedand sometimes requiredto deny harassment victims due process. If implemented, these rules would allow schools to subject survivors to biased, retraumatizing investigations or mediations that favor named harassers over their victims, and would let schools delay even these sham investigations indefinitely at the expense of the affected students education. <br/><br/>ED should immediately withdraw its current proposal and dedicate its efforts to advancing policies that ensure equal access to education for all students, including students who experience sexual harassment.<br/> <br/>Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the NPRM.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Veronica Bourassa<br/>Evensville, TN 37332

INFO - Comment: I am writing to express my disappointment with the US Department of Agriculture's decision to withdraw the 2017 final Horse Protection Act rule, which was intended to curb the rampant abuses associated with "soring" (Docket No. APHIS-2011-0009 "Horse Protection; Licensing of Designated Qualified Persons and Other Amendments"). An upgrade to the HPA is desperately needed as horses continue to suffer under a status quo that allows that industry to police itself despite the obvious conflict of interest.<br/><br/>According to the USDA's own review of data in recent years, there remains a persistent and vast discrepancy between violations found by industry appointed inspectors vs. those found by USDA inspectors (despite the latter attending only a small proportion of shows). Unfortunately, it is clear that the industry continues to turn a blind eye to evidence of soring.<br/><br/>Rather than withdraw the rule, the USDA should reissue the rulemaking until the department is prepared to move forward with a new HPA rule containing, at a minimum, all the key components of the 2017 rule. Importantly, the 2017 rule included prohibitions on ankle chains and other "action devices" associated with soring and eliminated the failed industry-run self-enforcement system.<br/><br/>Over 100,000 public comments were submitted in support of the 2017 rule; hundreds of members of Congress voiced their support as well. The 2017 HPA rule would achieve many of the recommendations outlined in the USDA Office of Inspector General audit and the recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report, both of which called for an end to the industry self-policing scheme.<br/><br/>In 2021, the USDA announced that the "development of a new and improved HPA proposal [was] a top regulatory priority," but the decision to withdraw the 2017 rule, coupled with the lack of progress on a new rule, suggests satisfaction with the status quo and that the USDA is not serious about fulfilling its legal duty to end soring.<br/><br/>The wide range of abusive practices associated with soring have plagued the Tennessee walking horse industry for decades. The USDA must expeditiously issue a new HPA rule in order to protect horses from abuse.

INFO - Title: Comment from Daniel Hock
INFO - Comment: I write to commend NHTSA for taking steps to ensure vehicles are safer for people outside cars in its revised New Car Assessment Program &lpar;NCAP&rpar;. Such a program is sorely needed and long overdue. For over a decade, the number of pedestrians and cyclists killed on our streets has steadily risen every year and its little secret that the size of todays cars and trucks fuel this epidemic.<br/><br/>However, NHTSA needs to do significantly more to protect people on foot, on bikes, and using mobility devices from the increasing threat of large vehicles. I join America Walks and other organizations to ask that NHTSA revise its pedestrian crashworthiness evaluation with the following recommendations and implement it without delay.<br/><br/>All vehicles should be held to the highest safety standards and NHTSAs proposed pass/fail grade for pedestrian crashworthiness falls short. Under NHTSAs current proposal, a vehicle could receive a failing grade for pedestrian crashworthiness, but still earn a five-star safety rating. This is unacceptable and misrepresents a vehicle as safe when it is not. Results from pedestrian crashworthiness evaluations should be incorporated in NCAPs star rating system. <br/><br/>The proposed pedestrian crashworthiness evaluation fails to address limited driver visibility, a known safety flaw for larger vehicles. An Insurance Institute of Highway Safety study shows that the blind spots of SUVs and pickup trucks make their drivers three to four times more likely to hit a pedestrian when turning than a passenger car. Driver visibility needs to be evaluated to determine whether or not a vehicle is safe for pedestrians. <br/><br/>For a consumer information program like NCAP to be successful, results need to be available at the point of sale. NHTSAs proposal to post results from pedestrian crashworthiness evaluations on its website and not post them on the vehicle &lpar;the Monroney label&rpar; severely undermines the program. Pedestrian crashworthiness ratings should be added to the Monroney label itself or a supplemental sticker on vehicles that is visible to the consumer. <br/><br/>I also ask NHTSA to commit to including standards and technologies that protect people outside cars in an updated Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards &lpar;FMVSS&rpar;. Vehicle safety standards that save the lives of people outside cars shouldnt be left to consumer choice. NHTSA mandates equipment like seatbelts and airbags that protect vehicle occupants; it needs to update the FMVSS to protect everyone on our streets, not just those in vehicles.

INFO - Comment: I hereby incorporate by reference and support the comment opposing AAM submitted by Studio City For Quiet Skies, Comment ID DOT-OST-2023-0079-0021: https://www.regulations.gov/comment/DOT-OST-2023-0079-0021<br/><br/>The ambitious plan to commercialize AAM by 2025, scaling up by 2028, lacks specific federal regulations and demands deceleration. Communities that would be subject to noise/health impacts OPPOSE AAM. The following is required:<br/> <br/>STUDIES/RESEARCH: The rush to implement AAM must be slowed. Short-term focus should be on conducting thorough health/environmental studies, cost-benefit analysis, comprehensive/independent research, pilot programs, data analysis, community outreach to ensure responsible innovation, and addressing potential adverse impacts to people on the ground.<br/> <br/>ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW: Environmental review must be thorough and not streamlined as indicated by FAA in its “Innovate 28” AAM Implementation Plan.<br/><br/>ASSESS CUMULATIVE IMPACTS: Stacking AAM below other aircraft (commercial, G.A., helicopters) at 400 AGL, and across multiple airports, has the potential to significantly impact noise levels, visual pollution, and the overall well-being of people, as well as having privacy and security implications. Adverse Cumulative Impacts on health, quality of life, sleep, and environment must be thoroughly studied as part of NEPA and closely monitored during early pilot programs. It is crucial to address health/environmental impacts through implementation of strict emission standards, exercise of local control over ground infrastructure, flight restrictions, and appropriate regulations. Zero-emission vehicles should be prioritized, and regs should ensure AAM operations adhere to land use rules, protect wildlife corridors/natural habitats, and avoid high fire zones.<br/> <br/>SET BENCHMARKS FOR DEVELOPMENT: Key considerations include benchmarks for development, staged rollouts, pilot programs, community engagement, equitable access, reducing noise/environmental impacts, and prioritizing public welfare.<br/> <br/>FEDERAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK: The public rejects the “fly now, regulate later” approach. Studies/research must guide the establishment of a Regulatory Framework before AAM implementation to ensure responsible integration. Establish new rules specifically designed for new entrants like AAM, rather than modifying existing regs to include AAM. Do not include AAM in ANCA. Federal regs must address major concerns regarding safety, noise, health, privacy, economic damage, environmental, and quality of life impacts on the ground.  <br/> <br/>PUBLIC AS FULL STAKEHOLDER: The public is unaware of how this world-changing technology will alter the character of neighborhoods, impacting quality of life for all. Providing the public full stakeholder status, along with ensuring absolute transparency, are crucial, and DOT should prioritize input from the general public rather than solely industry perspectives.<br/> <br/>PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT: Learn lessons from flawed programs like NextGen. Community engagement for AAM should involve representation of community stakeholders, early involvement in decision-making processes and at every stage of implementation, meaningful dialogue and collaboration, and elevation of environmental impacts as a co-equal priority. Community understanding/acceptance must not be the goal of community engagement.<br/> <br/>LOCAL CONTROL: FAA must not dispute states’, cities’, and regions’ local control over land use, infrastructure, electricity, aircraft operations, and impacts that allows for tailored approaches prioritizing the well-being of communities. Rushed implementation without comprehensive regulation risks inadequate oversight.<br/> <br/>MODEL NOISE PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION: Proper noise assessment is essential to ensure communities are not exposed to increased noise levels. Metrics, used for decision-making purposes, including N-above, T-above, Lmax, A and C weighting, must be used to accurately assess noise impacts. Cumulative noise effects from other aircraft should also be computed to understand overall noise burdens. <br/> <br/>EQUITY: AAM for the sole purpose of transporting the uber-wealthy must be avoided and distinguished from medical transport, with data collection differentiating between these applications for informed decision-making/regulation. <br/> <br/>NO NEED BUT GREED: FAA has not demonstrated actual need for AAM beyond limited emergency applications. The wealthy skipping traffic does not demonstrate need. The climate crisis must not be ignored to accommodate a frivolous new industry that could strain electric grids nationwide.<br/> <br/>CONCLUSION: It must be considered whether the benefits of AAM outweigh the substantial cost to the public and environment. By prioritizing studies, research, pilot programs, data analysis, community impacts, and state/local regulation, while involving the public in decision-making, it can be determined as to whether AAM implementation should proceed. <br/><br/>

The First Amendment's Establishment Clause prohibits the government from providing funding to churches for religious purposes, including religious worship and proselytization. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, this rule ignores constitutional limitations and allows places of worship to obtain forgivable loans even for inherently religious activities, including clergy salary and rent and utility costs for places of worship. This is not acceptable.<br/><br/>American taxpayers must not be forced to pay for the religious beliefs of others. This goes against the very core of religious freedom protected by the First Amendment and our rights as Americans. As Thomas Jefferson once said, "to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical."<br/><br/>I'm not asking you to ban loans to places of worship altogether. Please just ensure that when they use those funds for inherently religious activity, including clergy salary and payments for buildings used for religious purposes, that portion of the loan is not forgivable. This is a fair and reasonable compromise that will protect vital constitutional interests. <br/><br/>I also object to the overly broad exemption SBA has granted to religious organizations receiving this funding to engage in employment discrimination based on their beliefs. Taxpayers should not be forced to fund discrimination. <br/><br/>Please, as you implement the Paycheck Protection Program, ensure that every American's religious freedom is respected by protecting the separation of religion and government.

EPAs duty to protect public health and welfare means taking urgent steps to reduce vehicle emissions, including GHGs, to the greatest extent possible. The current proposal will increase emissions. Failing to take the strongest possible action now will ensure escalated global warming and major loss of life and health. Maintaining the standards developed and agreed to by the U.S. government, auto makers and the state of California in 2012 for model years 2021-2026 (previously issued standards) is justified by thorough analysis and public input. Global warming has already set in motion changes that will further accelerate warming. Increasing emissions cannot be justified based on science, cost or available technology. I am terried about what will happen to our planet and our country if we don't work harder to cut auto emissions. Thanks.

I appreciate that USFWS is proposing new stricter regulations. That is an important step. Now is the time to take the next step and initiate a total ban on this inhumane trade, a trade that spells death from poaching or a lifetime spent swaying in a barren zoo enclosure.<br/><br/>Despite statements to the contrary by proponents of trophy hunting, there is little economic benefit to African countries from allowing this cruelty. It only destroys the viability of elephant populations and impedes conservation efforts. Also, keeping elephants locked up in tiny zoo enclosures does nothing to conserve them in the wild.<br/><br/>By taking this action to halt all import permits of African elephants, the US will send the message that it is committed to protecting these highly endangered animals. That message will resonate with all other nations to stop any plans to import elephants or elephant trophies. Here in the 21st century, it is time to finally save these majestic elephants from slaughter and lifetimes of captivity. I beseech you to strengthen regulations by halting any more decimation of elephant populations.

These changes would drastically weaken the interagency consultation provision of the Endangered Species Act -- widely considered the most important and effective provision of the Act -- and also undercut the Endangered Species Act's proper role in addressing the impacts of climate change on our nation's most imperiled wildlife. <br/><br/>For 35 years the Endangered Species Act has protected imperiled species from the effects of potentially harmful federal projects. The strength of the Endangered Species Act has been the checks and balances created by interagency consultation between federal agencies that build roads, issue logging permits, and lease oil and gas rights among other projects, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and National Marine Fisheries Services, whose primary responsibility is the conservation of endangered species. <br/><br/>Interagency consultation ensures that federal projects that may impact America's most imperiled wildlife are independently reviewed by federal wildlife experts and project modifications are made where necessary. In the overwhelming majority of consultations federal projects move forward with little or no significant changes.<br/><br/>The regulations you recently proposed would eliminate interagency consultation on thousands of federal projects that pose a risk to endangered and threatened species each year. The changes will almost certainly result in detrimental impacts on endangered and imperiled species and a higher propensity to overlook opportunities to avoid such impacts.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the fact that these are the most significant changes to regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act in more than 20 years, you have provided the public just 30 days in which to submit comments, not the traditional 90, and prevented anyone from sending their comments by email. <br/><br/>I request you set an additional 60 days to allow the public an opportunity to meaningfully comment on these proposed regulations.<br/><br/>I also urge you to not to finalize these regulatory changes. <br/><br/>Thank you.

Such tactics include killing mother bears and cubs at den sites with the aid of artificial light, baiting brown and black bears, killing wolves and coyotes with pups during their denning season, killing swimming caribou or killing caribou from a motorboat, and using dogs to hunt black bears.<p>Allowing the use of brutal hunting tactics on highly vulnerable wildlife, such as denning mothers and cubs, is not only unconscionable, but also unlawful. Congress provided a clear directive to the National Park Service to 'provide for the maintenance of sound populations of, and habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens of Alaska and the Nation' for the 'benefit, use, education, and inspiration of present and future generations' (16 U.S.C. 3101(a)). These extreme hunting methods, which are neither used nor endorsed by the majority of sport hunters, violate this directive.<p>These barbaric, scientifically baseless, and unnecessary tactics decimate predators on public lands and undermine protection of natural diversity solely to boost numbers of prey species and cater to trophy hunters. Predators play a critically important role in an ecosystem, ensuring both diversity and proper ecosystem function. Brutal hunting methods such as baiting, hounding, killing young animals, and killing animals at their den sites should have no place on national preserve lands.<p>The 2015 NPS rule is consistent with federal law and the best available science, was subject to public review and comment, and outlaws only the most extreme hunting tactics in Alaska. I strongly encourage NPS to reject this deeply troubling proposal, and urge the agency to keep the 2015 prohibitions in place.

INFO - Comment: As a small-business operator in South Carolina, I'm very disappointed to learn that the FDA is considering a ban on licensed retailers selling flavored cigars to adults 21 and older. Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning flavored cigars could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since flavored cigars alone generate $4 to $5 billion in annual retail sales and make up 37% to 47% of popular price large cigars sold in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of flavored cigars could undermine my ability to operate by impacting my revenue. <br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, sales of flavored cigars could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime in many states.    Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of flavored cigars is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.  <br/>

INFO - Comment: Dear Fish and Wildlife Service,<br/><br/>Thank you for undoing some of the Trump administration’s damage to critical Endangered Species Act regulations. I am heartened by many aspects of your proposed restoration. <br/><br/>However, there are multiple aspects of your proposed rules that are insufficient for the challenges that endangered wildlife are facing.  <br/><br/>First, you must go back to the drawing board and fully restore section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, which governs interagency consultation. For 50 years it's been established that the federal government should not engage in activities that could jeopardize species' survival or destroy habitat they need to survive and recover.  <br/><br/>Specifically, the Biden administration must rescind the addition of “as a whole” to section 402.02. This Trump-era language created an enormous loophole, inconsistent with the intent of the Endangered Species Act itself. The nefarious “as a whole” language is a free pass to destroy critical habitat as long as the total destruction of a species’ entire critical habitat is avoided. This is especially damaging for wide-ranging and migratory species, from piping plover to marbled murrelet, from salmon to lynx. This language also ignores the cumulative impact of different causes of habitat destruction over time. And it goes against the science-based establishment of critical habitat to ensure both the species survival and recovery, instead treating some areas of critical habitat as expendable.   <br/><br/>Additional definition changes from the Trump era that need to be reversed include one that creates unnecessary confusion when examining an agency action that is ongoing, or a continuation of past activities as opposed to something new (“environmental baseline” section 402.02).   <br/><br/>Additionally, you must reverse Trump’s damaging changes in section 424.11(e) that allow plants and animals to be prematurely delisted. It is essential that species recovery meets all science-based standards before removing the backstop of Endangered Species Act protections that have kept so many species alive.  <br/><br/>Each of the many changes to Endangered Species Act regulations made by the Trump administration weakened protections for threatened and endangered species at a time when we must be doing everything in our power to fight the biodiversity crisis and recover species from the brink of extinction. Despite the broad support for restoring and strengthening the rules that implement the Act, you’ve left multiple loopholes from the Trump-era rollbacks in place, which will undoubtedly jeopardize future efforts to protect wildlife and habitat. By failing to fully restore the Endangered Species Act rules, you've left a significant job less than half done. Now is the time to get this right; we have no more time to waste.<br/><br/>Decades ago in my Biology of Populations class we seemed to focus on population growth. Now we must focus on population decline. However, we must focus on so many endangered species that it is a math problem consisting of great numbers of populations in exponential decline. This mathematics is best understood only when political issues are eliminated and biodiversity issues are viewed independently. The results will not only save humanity, but also life on earth for many familiar species. Thank you <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Richard Krygowski<br/>137 Egrets Walk Ln  Ponte Vedra Beach, FL 32082-3660

INFO - Title: Comment from Lourdes Oliva Lopez
INFO - Comment: My son, Julian, is now 17 years old but when he was 3 years old the medication "Singulair" (having been taking it for over 12 months) caused severe neurological damage at the time which produced atonic (head drop seizures) where his neck would lose muscle tone for seconds and his head would drop forward and he would slam his face on tables, etc. We were told by 2 pediatric neurologists he would not be cured as what he had was a severe and rare form of epileptic syndrome that would eventually make him a vegetable. Before the head drop seizures he developed what we thought at first were "tics" where his eyes would roll back and he would make vocal sounds. He also experienced inexplicable night terrors and hallucinations where he would point out to "things" on the wall which we could not see. He also became obsessive about things such as if my husband turned right while driving instead of left and the order of his toys etc. We also witnessed aggression and lots of anger on his part which were NOT normal for him.<br/><br/>Even after stopping the Singulair (montelukast) cold turkey on October 31, 2005 as a result of our parental suspicions - our son experienced speech language issues which required a speech therapist in school for the next 7 years. Prior to the Singulair he had been potty trained but after being on Singulair for several months regressed to needing a diaper to prevent wetting accidents. Up until 2016 he continued to need incontinence disposables at night due to the continued nocturnal enuresis throughout the years. We were able to finally take control of this by setting an alarm for me to wake him up continuously over the course of a year until his bladder was fully trained to contain urine the entire night at the age of 14.<br/><br/>Those days at the ages of 3 and 4, were the darkest days of our lives but with fervent prayers from within our home, family and even strangers, and with the help of a wonderful anti-seizure drug called Keppra during that time from December 2005 through May 2007, after a follow up EEG he was found to be "cured". Doctors called him a "miracle child" and so he IS our miracle child. He has thrived and become a bright, warm and caring young man - he gets wonderful grades in school and is just a regular polite and caring "teen".<br/><br/>FAST FORWARD to the fall of 2015 (at the age of 13) - UNFORTUNATELY, twice that year and both times at church - he "passed out"/fainted and the first time we just said okay he fainted - can happen to anyone. The 2nd time in October 2015 his brother, and a church volunteer noticed and brought to our attention, as this happened while they were both away from us in the back of the church - that he was "twitching" on the floor when he collapsed. I almost passed out myself with terror of this dreadful illness coming back somehow after 9 years!<br/><br/>Needless to say he was referred for a "just in case" evaluation to his original neurologist and underwent a sleep deprived EEG. Very sadly, the Dr. brought bad news - he said the EEG was completely abnormal and that although he was not having the same type of seizures he had when he was 3 years old, that he was having generalized "absence" seizures which they were able to trigger during the EEG test with the strobe lights and also by asking him to breath abnormally (hyperventilate) which would explain how he may have passed out in church with the long garment, the heat that day, etc. but instead of just being an absence seizure in church, the Dr. now believes it progressed most likely to a "grand-mal" tonic-clonic seizure since he collapsed and was on the floor twitching. He started the new Keppra XR medication and is up to 3000 mg daily now since November of 2015. His neurologist retired and he is now under the care of an adult epileptologist with Mission Neurology in Asheville NC. The subsequent EEGs continue to be abnormal and seem to be pointing to spike and slow wave and polyspike complex in both frontal regions of the brain but with a definite higher amplitude in the right frontal region compared to left. This burst of epileptiform activity can last up to 1-1.5 seconds and occurs at a frequency of approximately 5 spikes per second. During the drowsy and light sleep state a negative phase reversal at F4 is seen.<br/><br/>My heart is devastated - Julian has the kindest heart/soul - why? <br/><br/>The neurologists to date still do not validate our suspicions on the SINGULAIR (montelukast) having caused damaged to his brain. Unfortunately, despite the new warnings on the boxes they mostly dismiss this - even with the highlighted neuropsychiatric effects!<br/><br/>If I could do something differently in life, it would most definitely be to have NEVER given our son, Julian, the poison of Singulair for a full year at a critical time of brain development. I am so heartbroken :(<br/><br/>There is NO history of epilepsy in our families. We have 2 other healthy sons ages 21 and 12 and the only difference is that thankfully they NEVER took Singulair (montelukast).

INFO - Comment: Dear Acting Director Souza, <br/><br/>I oppose the redefinition of “harm” under the Endangered Species Act. For more than 40 years, the harm definition has protected endangered species by prohibiting acts that result in significant habitat modification or degradation that results in actual death or injury to a species.  <br/><br/>This prohibition has been absolutely critical to saving species from extinction. It has prevented cutting of old-growth forests where spotted owls nest, stopped development in Florida panther habitat, and so much more.  <br/><br/>Stripping the definition of harm to leave out habitat destruction will open the floodgates to developers, loggers, miners, oil and gas drillers, and others to destroy endangered species habitat, driving species to extinction in the process. <br/><br/>The harm definition has underpinned conservation of endangered species in biological opinions and habitat conservation plans for decades, requiring reasonable measures to avoid habitat destruction in exchange for incidental take permits. Rescinding the definition will upend this sensible approach and undermine existing protections that have prevented the extinction of more than 99 percent of species protected by the Endangered Species Act. <br/><br/>I strongly urge you *not* to finalize rescission of this definition and uphold our commitment to saving endangered species and the natural world.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Maria Williamson<br/>TX 77532

Guns sold without background checks—both online and at gun shows—are a huge source for gun traffickers and people looking to avoid a background check. These guns often end up trafficked across state lines, recovered at crime scenes in major cities, and used against police officers. This contributes to the gun violence epidemic plaguing our country. The long-standing lack of clarity around which sellers must become licensed and run background checks has made this problem all the worse. <br/><br/>I support the clear common-sense standard laid out in this rule: Anyone offering guns for sale online or at a gun show is presumed to be trying to make a profit and should therefore be licensed and run a background check on their customers.

It appears the Biden Administration agrees with this unAmerican attitude of tolerance for everything except traditional Biblical beliefs held by truly devout Christians and Jews.<br/><br/>Political correctness and 'wokeism' have been the death of free thought, free inquiry, free speech and in the end, the freedom to achieve excellence.<br/><br/>I write to oppose the proposed Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) concerning the Religious Liberty and Free Inquiry Rule (Free Inquiry Rule).<br/><br/>As you know, the Free Inquiry Rule upholds fundamental First Amendment rights, ensuring that public institutions of higher education comply with their stated policies of respecting freedom of speech and academic freedom. Furthermore, the rule ensures that religious organizations receive equal treatment to nonreligious ones.<br/><br/>The Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional to discriminate against a religious organization based solely on its religious affiliation.

INFO - Comment: Dear Secretary Becerra,<br/><br/>I write to comment on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families, “Safe and Appropriate Foster Care Placement Requirements for Titles IV-E and IV-B” (RIN: 0970-AD03).<br/><br/>This rule would impose an ideological agenda on the foster care system, to the detriment of children and the exclusion of people of faith. In the name of affirming adult choices, the rule would significantly reduce resources for children by falsely labeling people and religious organizations “unsafe” and “inappropriate.”<br/><br/>The proposed rule would force states to screen foster parents and foster-care organizations, making sure that they will “affirm” LGBT identities of children in their care, in the name of ensuring “safe and appropriate” care. But affirming a child’s self-proclaimed sexual identity, without regard for his or her sex, is harmful, and requiring it will exclude good people and organizations from helping kids struggling with their gender or sexual identity in an already over-taxed system. The new criteria would disqualify most faith-based providers from serving these kids and would essentially label people of faith and religious organizations “unsafe”!<br/><br/>This rule is predicated upon at least two false premises. First, it uncritically accepts the assertion that we must “affirm” a child’s sexual identity or risk pushing them toward suicide. Increasingly, there is better evidence that shows “gender affirming care” is causing more mental health distress rather than resolving it.<br/><br/>In fact, high-quality studies show that completed suicides do not go down when people are “affirmed” in a transgender identity, and that the overwhelming majority of children who are not “affirmed” in a transgender identity desist by the time they go through puberty—up to 70 percent of girls, and up to 98 percent of boys. It is essential to note the other increased risk factors for suicide that have been cited in the transgender-identifying population, namely a significantly greater incidence of adverse childhood experiences. A recent study, for example, from the pro-LGBT Williams Institute showed 45 percent of transgender identifying people reported childhood sexual abuse, 44 percent of transgender-identifying people reported childhood physical abuse, and fully 75 percent of transgender-identifying people reported childhood emotional abuse.<br/><br/>For the trauma survivor, an ideology that suggests a child can be born in the wrong body, unfortunately, fits hand-in-glove with the mentality of a person who self-harms and wants to dissociate from any aspect of their being or body that highlights vulnerability. Yet, despite this knowledge, clinical settings and research studies promoting transgenderism have not properly accounted for this significant variable and how it relates to gender dysphoria. These three resources explore these problems in greater detail: “Suicide Risk and Gender Transition: The Facts” (https://www.frc.org/blog/2021/07/suicide-risk-and-gender-transition-facts), “Do Not Sterilize Children: Why Physiological Gender Transition Procedures for Minors Should Be Prohibited” (https://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF20J34.pdf), and “The Trans Youth Phenomenon: Critiques & Hard Questions” (https://www.frc.org/booklet/the-trans-youth-phenomenon-critiques-hard-questions).<br/><br/>Second, it labels any foster-care family or institutional provider "unsafe” and “inappropriate.” This is dangerous ground both legally and practically. Legally, it infringes on the right of people of faith to continue to make an outsized contribution providing homes and services to children in the foster-care system. Practically, it threatens to dramatically restrict the number of homes and service providers available to help children in an already strained system.<br/><br/>Foster care agencies have already been affected by challenges to the religious freedom of providers or foster families. This rule will further discourage religious families and individuals from applying to be foster parents or seeking employment in the foster-care profession. Religious people who worry that their sincerely held religious beliefs are deemed to not be “safe and appropriate” by the federal government are likely to think twice before entering the child welfare system. We need more, not fewer, loving families to open their homes for children in the child welfare system, and more, not fewer, individuals to dedicate their lives to helping these children. HHS should not be applying pressure on state agencies to discourage faith-based providers and religious families.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this rule will only harm, not help, children in foster care. For these reasons, I oppose implementation of this rule.

Such development would be incompatible with meeting urgently needed commitments to address the climate crisis.  To demonstrate climate leadership and meet our commitments, the nation needs to move rapidly away from burning fossil fuels. There is no room for expansion, particularly in the Arctic, where oil would not come to market for years. The huge infrastructure build-out required would lock us into reliance on fossil fuels, while bringing further stress to a region feeling climate effects even more acutely than lower latitudes.  I urge the administration to take measures to bring its management of the Western Arctic in line with its commitment to address the climate crisis.   <br/><br/>The proposed regulations are a step in the right direction but do not go far enough.  They offer important incremental protections for some of the Western Arctic’s most ecologically and culturally important areas, such as Teshekpuk Lake, an internationally vital wetland critical for birds from around the globe and for caribou herds that are integral to Alaska Native communities in the region.  However, they do not do enough to address the most imminent threat to the region and the planet—the over two million acres of existing oil leases in the Western Arctic that this administration inherited.  Development on these existing leases—like Willow—threatens the sensitive habitat of the Western Arctic and the nation’s ability to meet its climate goals.   <br/><br/>The current environmental analysis of the Western Arctic, written in the previous administration, fails to study the impact oil development in the region would have on the climate and the nation’s ability to rapidly reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to meet climate goals.  We urge the administration to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the climate impacts of Western Arctic oil development, and to bring its management of the region in line with climate policy by expanding its proposed regulations to require limits on drilling on the millions of acres already leased to oil companies to protect the climate and the fragile resources of the region already under severe strain from climate change.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Sharon Rothe<br/>2202 Johnson Dr  Rockaway, NJ 07866-5844

INFO - Comment: Dear Transportation Secretary Buttigieg,<br/><br/>As a person of faith and conscience, I am writing to ask you to enact the boldest and strongest possible clean car standards.<br/><br/>Stronger fuel economy standards will reduce pollution. This will reduce health care costs and protect our health, particularly of the most vulnerable in our communities. Stronger standards will also spur innovation in the development of new clean car technologies and electrification of the transportation sector. If we fail to drive toward 100% clean car sales by 2030, or soon thereafter, we will fall behind other countries who have a clear vision of a clean energy future. The window for meaningful action to address climate change is closing. We ask NHSTA to do its part to address climate pollution starting with the largest sources like transportation. <br/><br/>This is a moral opportunity to follow the science and show the world that the U.S. is serious about enacting climate solutions. It is possible and it can be done in a way that is beneficial to our country and to the world. <br/><br/>I urge you to finalize Alternative 3, which will push automakers to make the most efficient vehicles possible. <br/><br/>Thank you for this opportunity to comment.

INFO - Comment: Dear Director Angelle,<br/><br/>I am writing to express strong opposition to the proposed revisions to the Well Control Rule. This rule was one of the only safety regulations implemented in the aftermath of the most devastating oil spill disaster in our nation?s history. Dismantling safety measures like the Well Control Rule while the administration simultaneously seeks a radical expansion of offshore drilling in nearly all federal waters is simply unacceptable. <br/><br/>In 2010, BP?s Deepwater Horizon rig exploded following an exploratory well blowout, which killed 11 crew members and gushed over 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The oil spill continued for 87 days as engineers tried and failed to seal the blowout. Six years later, the Well Control Rule was established to help prevent another BP-like disaster. There are far too few safety standards in place for dirty and dangerous offshore drilling and actively weakening existing safeguards is unimaginable. Weakening this rule would prioritize the profits of oil and gas companies over the safety of our environment and coastal communities. We cannot afford another offshore drilling tragedy.<br/><br/>I strongly oppose this reckless rollback of safety standards for offshore drilling. The administration is putting our marine life and healthy oceans at unnecessary risk by revising a measure that did not go far enough to begin with. I urge you to reject this proposal that would make offshore drilling even more dangerous ? we need much more safety, not less.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Donna Brooks

INFO - Comment: In order for the Biden administration to assure the public that this new U.S.-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) initiative will be a departure from the problematic U.S.-Kenya trade talks initiated in secret during the Trump administration, I urge  U.S. negotiators to prioritize a transparent negotiating process, as well as worker rights, sustainability, racial equity, and consumer safeguards in any proposed U.S.-Kenya STIP. <br/><br/>Thank you for considering my views in four crucial areas: <br/><br/>NEGOTIATING PROCESS<br/>The process for negotiating any U.S.-Kenya STIP must be transparent and participatory. Civil society organizations, Congress and the public must be invited to help formulate U.S. positions and comment on draft U.S. proposals, not just via this public comment period, but throughout the entire course of the negotiations. Specifically, the U.S. must publish draft versions of STIP proposals and solicit public comment upon them prior to tabling them. STIP negotiating rounds should be announced in advance and include public stakeholder engagement and interactions with negotiators from both nations. And proposed texts, related materials, and any consolidated texts must also be quickly published after each negotiating round so that the public can review and comment on the latest proposals while there is still opportunity to make real changes. These measures are necessary not only to ensure STIP outcomes that align with the Biden administration’s goals, but to rebuild public faith in trade policy making after years of backroom deal making.<br/><br/>DIGITAL ECONOMY<br/>At a moment when policymakers are finally beginning to grapple with Big Tech’s outsized power over the economy and society, STIP must not constrain the ability of our government or the Kenyan government to enact new digital governance measures. Specifically, STIP must not be allowed to prioritize corporate interests ahead of labor rights, anti-offshoring measures and the protection of gig economy workers; to help corporations hide the discriminatory effects of source code and algorithms through secrecy provisions; to undermine consumer privacy and data security by prohibiting limits on data flows or rules on the location of computing facilities; to shield firms from corporate accountability via overly broad content liability waivers; or to promote corporate consolidation by banning limits on size and services offered by tech conglomerates or by limiting anti-trust measures in any form. Legitimate trade concerns regarding the digital economy include: ensuring that goods purchased online across borders meet labor, environmental and consumer safety standards, including by lowering de minimis levels; preventing business misclassification so that so-called “digital platforms” involved in transportation, hospitality, healthcare, retail, education and other industries cannot evade labor, consumer and other regulations imposed on “brick-and-mortar” businesses; combating high-tech discrimination by expanding access to source codes and algorithms by governments and civil society; and introducing corporate liability for personal data collected, traded, sold or stolen without consumers’ explicit consent.<br/><br/>LABOR<br/>To prevent the offshoring of good-paying jobs, STIP must include strong, binding labor standards explicitly based on the International Labor Organization (ILO) Conventions and their accompanying jurisprudence. These standards must go beyond those found in past trade agreements, and the United States must assure that the rules are being implemented and respected on the ground before allowing any commercial aspects of a STIP agreement to take effect. Formal protections for joint labor activities across borders, including collective bargaining, must also be established, and resources for ongoing monitoring and robust mechanisms for swift and certain enforcement must also be included.<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENT & CLIMATE<br/>STIP must help advance and not undermine both countries’ efforts to combat catastrophic climate change, by including  a binding “climate peace clause” to ensure that policies either government deems necessary to implement their climate commitments under the Paris Agreement are free from challenge within trade tribunals whether via STIP, the WTO, or any other pact. STIP must likewise require countries to enforce Multilateral Environmental Agreements ratified by the U.S. or most countries in the world, including the Paris Agreement; establish limits on toxic pollution that are on par with U.S. standards; prohibit countries from weakening environmental standards to gain a trade advantage; completely exclude Investor-State Dispute Settlement, “Good Regulatory Practices” rules that can further empower corporations to undermine needed regulation and public safeguards, and other polluter-friendly, deregulatory measures.

INFO - Comment: Most of the students who hold F-1 VISA and come to the United States can make a big contribution to the good economy. Their stay can increase job opportunities in the United States because they have to buy groceries, live in houses or apartments, take public transportation, etc. They also make sure that Universities can get a lot of international students. Then Universities can be much better than before because students have to pay tuition. Establishing a fixed time period of extension of stay will stop foreign students from coming to the United States. The result will be an economic downturn, especially colleges will have a very difficult time.

It would restrict good citizenship by redefining all voter registration, non-partisan voter guides, legislative records, candidate debates or forums, get-out-the-vote reminders, even the mention of any issue that has been raised by a candidate as regulated political activity. <br/><br/>In addition, the proposed regulation will stifle the ability of non-profit groups to inform citizens about the Administration's judicial and political appointment by redefining those nominees as political candidates. This provision of the proposal has nothing to do with accountability for election spending. It will however reduce the Administration's accountability to the public. Citizens have the right to hear more than the Administration's line regarding what philosophies, policies, agendas political appointees represent. <br/><br/>Most concerning, REG-134417-13 gives the appearance that the IRS is trying to adopt regulations to achieve the same goals that motivated it to hold-up granting the applications of conservative organizations and launch intrusive investigations of Tea Party applicants.

Leaking, venting, and flaring from natural gas facilities wastes hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer owned natural resources every year. The new proposal eliminates key provisions which protect against exposure to dangerous pollutants and promotes the waste of 299 billion cubic feet of natural gas, enough energy to heat nearly 500,000 homes each year for the next ten years. In addition, your proposal is a huge step backward on the fight to tackle climate change, resulting in the same amount of short-term climate damage as 8.3 million cars driven over ten years.<br/> <br/>Rolling back the Methane and Waste Prevention Rule results in a free pass to oil and gas companies to waste American energy and pollute on our public lands. Capturing wasted gas would promote responsible energy production and job growth while safeguarding American health and royalty revenue.<br/><br/>I urge you to halt the effort to gut the rule and instead protect our public lands, health and pocketbooks from methane waste and pollution.

INFO - Comment: I commend the FDA for listening to the homeopathy community and posting a revised Draft Guidance rather than finalizing the previous one. However, I believe the FDA has not understood the homeopathy community completely. Though the agency purports to take a risk-based approach to policing homeopathic medicines, the new Draft Guidance would threaten the future of all homeopathy while increasing risk to consumers.<br/><br/>THE DRAFT GUIDANCE THREATENS ALL OF HOMEOPATHY<br/><br/>The Draft Guidance, if adopted, will allow the FDA to withdraw nontoxic, inherently safe generic name homeopathic medicines from the marketplace, not just particular brands or lots that have been improperly manufactured and/or labeled.<br/><br/>An initial review of public FDA records by Americans for Homeopathy Choice shows that safety concerns about properly manufactured and labeled homeopathic medicines appear nowhere. All of the FDA's concerns relate to improperly manufactured and/or labeled products which do not meet homeopathic standards.<br/><br/>If the FDA does not intend to withdraw properly manufactured and labeled generic name homeopathic medicines, why does it seek the authority to do so? It seems clear that the FDA intends to use this authority and has even mentioned specific medicines such as Belladonna, Nux vomica and Lachesis muta in its public statements regarding enforcement.<br/><br/>The FDA claims that its authority to withdraw generic name homeopathic medicines completely from the market results from the designation of homeopathic medicines as "new drugs." Nowhere in federal law are homeopathic medicines designated as "new drugs."<br/><br/>First, homeopathic medicines are not new in any sense of the word. Many of them pre-date the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 and most pre-date the 1962 amendments. Second, those amendments are designed to deal with inherently dangerous substances in order to determine whether the benefits of a particular substance used as a drug outweigh the risks.<br/><br/>Since properly manufactured and labeled homeopathic medicines are nontoxic and inherently safe when used as directed, these amendments do not apply to homeopathic medicines. There is no risk to weigh against the benefit of a properly manufactured and labeled homeopathic medicine used as directed. We know this from the rigorous reviews including human trials which homeopathic medicines undergo for safety and efficacy before inclusion in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States.<br/><br/>In short, the FDA cannot make new law through a guidance document. Only Congress can change the status of homeopathic drugs.<br/><br/>THE DRAFT GUIDANCE INCREASES RISK<br/><br/>Increased risk to consumers is a direct result of the threat posed by the Draft Guidance to all of homeopathy. By withdrawing properly manufactured and labeled generic name homeopathic medicines, the FDA will increase risks both to individual consumers and to public health in the following manner:<br/><br/>1. Many consumers will be denied access to the particular nontoxic, inherently safe homeopathic medicine which has helped them. These persons will increasingly be forced to seek higher-risk alternatives including OTC remedies that haven't been tested for safety and efficacy and pharmaceuticals, many of which are known to create dangerous and even fatal side-effects.<br/><br/>2. Homeopathic medicines may no longer be available to help address infections without creating antibiotic resistance or to treat pain without causing opioid dependence and death. Learn more at HomeopathyChoice.org/Research.<br/><br/>3. The FDA's risk-based approach makes no sense when applied to properly manufactured and labeled homeopathic medicines used as directed. These medicines are by definition nontoxic and inherently safe. They are not pharmacologically active and work by a different principle. To focus resources on policing them would divert resources from much riskier categories such as even properly manufactured and labeled pharmaceuticals which the agency recognizes have toxicity and interaction risks because of their much higher concentrations of active ingredients.<br/><br/>A proper focus for the risked-based approach would be products IMPROPERLY labeled as homeopathic as these may not be nontoxic or inherently safe.<br/><br/>I therefore request that the FDA revise this Draft Guidance to reflect 1) that generic name homeopathic medicines are nontoxic and inherently safe when properly manufactured and labeled and used as directed, 2) that homeopathic medicines are not "new drugs" and 3) that the agency's risk-based approach will be applied only to products IMPROPERLY labeled as homeopathic.

The simple formula created by the USDE of counting students in the school is easily applied and completed. Allocating funds based on students in poverty alone does not help the remaining students in the school. Having schools closed impacts a variety of students, not just those of low income families. Requiring schools to put together poverty data at this time of year is difficult at best. It involves gathering  household survey responses during a time of year when many families are vacationing and difficult to reach.  It complicates and delays the applying of a simple formula to get the much needed funds to schools now.  Without even knowing the amount of funding we will get it makes planning for the future extremely difficult.  Small Catholic Schools such as the one I am working at may be forced to close because of the additional costs to purchase technology, cleaning supplies, and ensure that the continued education of students is a reality.

I urge that they be rescinded.<br/><br/>The proposal is a one-two punch into the heart of the Endangered Species Act. It exempts a <br/>potentially huge number of federal projects from review by conservation experts at the Fish and <br/>Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service and then limits the projects that still <br/>are subject to review to a narrower set of impacts.<br/><br/>The proposed rule will allow the fox to guard the hen house because federal agencies interested <br/>in their own missions will now be the ones making Endangered Species Act determinations. <br/>These staff often do not have expertise in species conservation. In addition, the back and forth <br/>that often resulted in decisions that balanced species conservation concerns with the need for <br/>the proposed projects will be gone. Further, letting each agency make its own determinations will <br/>reduce clarity, consistency, transparency and accountability.<br/><br/>The proposed rule also narrows the definition of impacts in a way that appears intended to <br/>ensure that the Endangered Species Act cannot be used to consider climate change impacts on <br/>listed species. This short-sighted change undermines the goal of the act to preserve species no <br/>matter what the threat facing them. <br/><br/>I also object to the unusually short time period allowed for public comment on the proposed <br/>regulations and urge that it be extended to at least 90 days.<br/><br/>We owe it to our children and grandchildren to be good stewards of the environment and to leave <br/>behind a legacy of protecting endangered species and the special places they call home. <br/>Therefore, these proposed regulations should be withdrawn.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Annegret Klaua
