Wolves went  extienct , The onley reason you care now is because sheep and live stock are being hunted . Thats their fighting back . We started it we should just protect ourselves and livestock better keep wolves. They know when to stop hunting we dont, their  way is more sustainable .

NPS-2018-0005-54874,Comment on FR Doc # 2018-10735,"I am writing to respectfully encourage you not to move forward with this proposed rule (RIN 1024-AE38). <br/><br/>It would repeal a scientifically sound rule from 2015 prohibiting the use of some of the cruelest hunting tactics against predators on national preserves in Alaska. Such tactics include killing mother bears and cubs at den sites with the aid of artificial light, baiting brown and black bears, killing wolves and coyotes with pups during their denning season, killing swimming caribou or killing caribou from a motorboat, and using dogs to hunt black bears.<br/><br/>Allowing the use of brutal hunting tactics on highly vulnerable wildlife, such as denning mothers and cubs, is not only unconscionable, but also unlawful. Congress provided a clear directive to the National Park Service to ""provide for the maintenance of sound populations of, and habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens of Alaska and the Nation"" for the ""benefit, use, education, and inspiration of present and future generations"" (16 U.S.C. 3101(a)). These extreme hunting methods, which are neither used nor endorsed by the majority of sport hunters, violate this directive.<br/><br/>These barbaric, scientifically baseless, and unnecessary tactics decimate predators on public lands and undermine protection of natural diversity solely to boost numbers of prey species and cater to trophy hunters. Predators play a critically important role in an ecosystem, ensuring both diversity and proper ecosystem function. Brutal hunting methods such as baiting, hounding, killing young animals, and killing animals at their den sites should have no place on national preserve lands.<br/><br/>The 2015 NPS rule is consistent with federal law and the best available science, was subject to public review and comment, and outlaws only the most extreme hunting tactics in Alaska. I strongly encourage NPS to reject this deeply troubling proposal, and urge the agency to keep the 2015 prohibitions in place.",,,
DOT-OST-2024-0065-7390,Comment from Pedro Palomino,"Dear Secretary Buttigieg, <br/><br/>I urge your support for the allocation of one slot pair to Southwest Airlines so that it can begin daily nonstop service between Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) and Harry Reid International Airport (LAS). <br/><br/>Las Vegas is a destination that is in high demand. The variety of national and international events ranging from major sporting events to concerts to conventions are attracting a record number of visitors and diverse clientele to our community--all centered around the vibrant Las Vegas Strip. In 2023, 57.6 million people traveled to Las Vegas through Harry Reid International Airport breaking travel records. <br/><br/>Currently, there is only one roundtrip flight option between DCA and LAS daily. Adding a second DCA slot pair for DCA-LAS will augment travel options and open the Las Vegas market. By injecting Southwest competition into a market like DCA-LAS, it will produce lower airfares. With one additional roundtrip flight, the Department of Transportation (DOT) will enhance competition, expand access, and decrease ticket prices, offering travelers more convenient and affordable travel options to and from Las Vegas.<br/><br/>I strongly urge DOT to favorably consider Southwest's application under Docket DOT-OST-2024-0065 to provide daily and direct roundtrip service between DCA and Las Vegas. This will positively stimulate robust competition within the DCA-LAS market. Thank you for your consideration. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Pedro Palomino<br/>North Las Vegas,NV<br/>Pfpzepeda93@gmail.com",,,

ED-2021-OUS-0082-47786,Comment on FR Doc # 2021-15831,"President Joe Biden,<br/><br/>The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is broken. It was a simple but powerful idea:  borrowers working in public service would have their remaining student debt forgiven after 10 years. However, year after year, the Department of Education has rejected 98 out of every 100 public service workers who have applied to have their debts cancelled. I am just one of these student loan borrowers who teach in our schools, work in our hospitals, serve our country, and have shouldered the burden of keeping us safe on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. In exchange for our commitments to public service, we were promised that our student debt would be erased— a promise the Biden Administration should keep.<br/><br/>The student debt crisis also disproportionally hurts women and borrowers of color, magnifying inequality caused by a history of discrimination across the economy. The failure of PSLF isn’t just a broken promise, it is also a missed opportunity to address racial and gender inequity and deliver on President Biden’s promise to build back better. <br/><br/>President Biden and Education Secretary Cardona must immediately deliver student debt relief to public service workers.<br/><br/>For me and all borrowers who have worked for a decade in public service, President Biden and the Department of  Education should immediately discharge all of their federal student loans in full. Every borrower should immediately get credit for every month spent in public service, regardless of the type of federal student loan, payment plan, or other so-called requirements. Red tape and bureaucratic hurdles should not be a barrier to action—the Secretary should use all legal tools available to eliminate these unjust debts. <br/><br/>No more tricks or traps.

The new rules will likely alleviate the financial burden that has been placed on taxpayers for far too long. In the West we understand that fossil fuel development will continue for some time; we also understand that without proper oversight, we'll be left with the responsibility to clean up the mess. BLM's current rules fail to ensure that reclamation occurs in a complete way, and oil and gas companies have proven time and time again that without the proper incentive, they will abandon or sell their wells before cleaning them up.<br/><br/>For decades, the lack of sufficient reclamation bonds and oversight has left communities throughout the West to bear many impacts of oil and gas production, including many impacts that could have been avoided or mitigated. Many westerners live and often farm or ranch on land that overlies federal minerals. If they don't own the mineral rights, they often don't have any say in how oil companies use their property. When, as often happens, the companies orphan their wells or file for bankruptcy, the remaining infrastructure impedes ranching and other uses of the land. Unreclaimed wells can also leak toxic chemicals into groundwater, or damage the land. This often leads to a loss in livelihoods in the case of farmers and ranchers, or degraded health in the cases of rural communities.<br/><br/>I urge BLM to swiftly and effectively implement this common-sense rule to ensure communities like mine are protected from preventable harms from current and future oil and gas development.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Ms dorothy troup<br/>NM",,,

ED-2016-OESE-0056-0912,Comment on FR Doc # 2016-20989,"I am an educator and a member of the National Education Association, and I urge the U.S. Department of Education to re-think its proposed regulations to implement the Every Student Succeeds Act's (ESSA) Title I supplement, not supplant fiscal requirement.  To support all students, implementation should be done in a way that preserves the law's longstanding commitment to equity while also ensuring that local efforts to better serve students most in need are not undermined.<br/><br/>Ensuring that every student has a meaningful opportunity to learn is a State's first responsibility.  For students to graduate college and career-ready requires the State to provide students with the resources necessary according to their needs, such as access to high-quality preschool, a well-rounded curriculum, participation in advanced coursework, and a safe and healthy learning environment with modern materials, technology, and facilities.<br/><br/>Through no fault of their own, and despite greater effort in many places, poorer communities are often unable to provide the same opportunity to students as those provided to students in wealthier communities.  <br/><br/>The defining purpose of Title I under ESSA is to layer federal funds on top of State and local funds to provide students from low-income families with the extra supports they need to thrive.  Although ESSA requires States to be compliant with the supplement, not supplant provision, only local educational agencies (LEAs) must meet a specific test. ESSA places the burden on LEA's, which have more limited means to correct for any deficiencies, rather than the State.<br/><br/>In addition, there is evidence that not all LEAs parcel out State and local funds to their schools equitably, leaving students without access to the extra supports they need.  This is a secondary concern compared to the disparity in funding between districts in a State, but a disparity nonetheless that could be fixed with a sensible federal regulation.<br/><br/>Some of the Department's proposed rules in how an LEA can demonstrate compliance with the supplement, not supplant provision promote or support local efforts to make funding more equitable.  Other rules, although well-intended, may lead to funding practices that run counter to the notion of fairness and could undercut what is in the best interests of students.<br/><br/>To support collaboratively designed efforts, the rules should be flexible enough to ensure that local efforts to promote diversity that have been shown to benefit all students, such as through magnet schools or community schools, should not be harmed unintentionally.<br/><br/>Educators are experts at working with students and helping them reach their potential and we are ready to lead implementation efforts in our communities so students have access to the public schools they deserve.  The State in particular and the LEA must do their parts also. We must also support efforts to show what that funding is spent on so we ensure students have access to the supports they need to succeed.<br/><br/>The Department's regulation as proposed demonstrates its willingness to listen to practitioners due to the additional flexibility and workforce protections included compared to the original proposal offered earlier this year.  I am asking the Department to reexamine for a second time its proposed regulation to ensure that a narrow emphasis on spending comparisons, which says little about actual needs, does not prompt the same straightjacket adherence to compliance that failed under the No Child Left Behind law and preempts local approaches that may better serve our most vulnerable students.",,,

NOAA-NMFS-2023-0027-20726,"Comment from Pang, Carmen","Dear David Bernhart,<br/><br/>I am writing to you today in support of the proposal to set a year-round 10-knot vessel speed restriction in parts of the Gulf of Mexico to protect the endangered Rice’s whale from collisions and noise pollution. <br/><br/>Fossil fuel exploration development and other human activities have made the Rice’s whale one of the most endangered large whale species in the world. Your own scientists have concluded that the death of even a single reproductive-age female would jeopardize the existence of this species.  <br/><br/>So, any way to mitigate risks to these whales’ survival should be implemented immediately.  This includes mandatory speed limits and other reasonable measures governing vessel traffic within the whales’ habitat:  <br/><br/>** a mandatory 10-knot speed limit; <br/>** no vessel transits at night; <br/>** utilize visual observers and maintain a separation distance of 500 m from Rice's whales; <br/>** use and operate an Automatic Identification System, or notify NMFS of transits through the habitat;  <br/>** and report deviations from these requirements to NMFS. <br/><br/>Based on the latest science showing that these whales are persistently found in waters 100-400 meters deep all the way to the U.S.-Mexico border, these measures are needed not only within the whales’ previously identified “core habitat,” but throughout the Gulf.  Slowing down for Gulf of Mexico whales is a key step and only one part of the protection that is needed. These whales can recover as long as conditions improve, but that all depends on our actions. Unless the Biden administration takes significant conservation actions, the U.S. is likely to cause the first extinction of a great whale species resulting from human activity. We cannot let that happen.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Carmen Pang<br/>Decatur, GA 30030",,,

But instead of working to ensure everyone has equal access to comprehensive and nondiscriminatory services, HHS is asking for suggestions on how to expand the use of religious beliefs to discriminate and deny patients health care.<br/>It is not the case that faith-based entities are facing barriers to participating in HHS programs. What some faith-based entities have identified as barriers are simply non-discrimination requirements, as well as laws and programs conditions that require the delivery of essential and medically necessary health care services. The non-discrimination requirements, laws, and program conditions are not barriers, but rather fundamental legal requirements from which there can be no ""accommodation."" <br/><br/>A health care provider's religious beliefs should never determine the care a patient receives, and patients should not have to fear that a health care provider will turn them away due to religious or moral beliefs. Yet, hospitals use religious beliefs to refuse to treat a woman seeking abortion, even when it is the standard of care; pharmacies cite religion to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions, and providers refuse to treat LGBTQ individuals simply because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. When these refusals happen, patients suffer harmful health consequences. The harms caused by refusals to provide care have a disproportionate impact on those who already face multiple barriers to care, including communities of color, LGBTQ individuals, people facing language barriers, and those struggling to make ends meet.<br/>HHS should not be looking for ways to make it easier for entities to let religion dictate patient care. Instead, HHS should follow its mission and commit to protect individual health and well-being. It should ensure that all entities participating in HHS programs adhere to federal nondiscrimination requirements and requirements to provide patients with evidence-based essential care. And HHS should seek ways to address the real discrimination that women, LGBTQ people, and others face  every day.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Sharon Sickles<br/>  Des Moines, IA 50311",,,

This is especially harmful for species like the northern spotted owl, polar bear or gulf sturgeon that have large critical habitat designations but are still at risk of extinction. The provision ignores the basic fact that the single largest driver of extinction here and around the world is habitat loss and allows the Services to turn a blind eye to the vast majority of actions that harm critical habitat.  <br/> <br/>The proposed rule also retains the Trump-era definition of _environmental baseline,_ which lets federal agencies off the hook for past harms to endangered species from things like dam or highway construction by deeming these projects part of the baseline. It absolves the agencies of much responsibility for the damage caused by interrelated actions they facilitate, such as urban growth from highway expansion or increased global warming from emissions related to federal oil and gas leasing.  <br/> <br/>The remaining Trump-era regulations that the agencies are proposing to retain _ including the criteria for not prudent determinations for critical habitat _ are equally problematic and will continue to put endangered species at greater risk of extinction. Thus, I urge the Services to rescind them in their entirety without exception. <br/> <br/>There are some aspects of the proposed rule that I support. I am grateful that the Biden administration plans to restore the _blanket 4(d) rule,_ which will restore protections for threatened species. I also support again prohibiting consideration of economic impacts when deciding to protect species.  <br/><br/>However, while the proposed rule restores some pieces of the Endangered Species Act regulations, it is wholly inadequate and represents a huge missed opportunity to make meaningful progress to recover our most vulnerable animals and plants on the 50th anniversary of the Act_s passage.  <br/> <br/>With time running out, we can_t afford more of the status quo. Combating the global wildlife extinction crisis will require the Services to be bolder and more visionary than any other administration in history. For these reasons, I urge the Services to not only rescind the Trump-era rollbacks in their entirety, but to also strengthen the implementation of the Endangered Species Act to avert the extinction crisis and curtail the ongoing loss of biodiversity in the United States and around the world.",,,

ATF-2023-0002-346102,Comment on FR Doc # 2023-19177,"Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers. <br/><br/>The ATF’s proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized. <br/><br/>1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale—or no sale at all—might require a license:<br/><br/>ATF’s rule claims that the agency has opted not to ""establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year"" that require licensure, and instead suggests that ""even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license.""<br/>However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who ""regular[ly]"" and ""repetitive[ly]"" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple ""firearms."" <br/><br/>2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:<br/><br/>Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted ""occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby."" According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF’s rule provides no such assurances.<br/><br/>3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:<br/><br/>Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer—private gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court’s Caniglia decision in 2021. <br/><br/>In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called ""welfare check."" But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police—and the Biden administration—with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.<br/><br/>4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:<br/><br/>One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have ""willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license."" Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior. <br/><br/>Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF’s footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don’t! <br/><br/>5. ATF’s backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration: <br/><br/>So-called ""Universal Background Checks"" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime. <br/><br/>The Biden Administration described this as ""moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation."" And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales. <br/><br/>But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.",,,

Protecting and recovering these natural climate solutions would be a crucial piece of U.S. climate policy.  <br/><br/>Safeguarding and expanding carbon-rich forests on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands is one of the most important, cost-effective, and timely approaches to fighting the climate crisis.

As an alfalfa farmer, I am requesting NRCS incentivize the use and integration of alfalfa in NRCS programs to capitalize on the unique environmental and conservation benefits it brings to the agricultural landscape.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Earlier this year, the House and Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee report language recognized alfalfa as a ‘climate-smart’ commodity with exceptional capacity for carbon sequestration and decreased reliance on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Alfalfa has many benefits: as a perennial crop, it offers unique opportunities for carbon sequestration in its extensive deep-rooted system; it requires less tillage and builds soil organic matter; it reduces erosion; it has been shown to produce much less methane in ruminant animal digestion, as opposed to feeding higher grain diets; it is a leguminous plant that utilizes ‘free’ nitrogen from the atmosphere and does not require additional nitrogen fertilizers which are carbon intensive. And yet, NRCS has virtually overlooked the nation’s 4th most valuable field crop when developing its conservation programs. THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Programs such as Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP); Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP); and Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) are just a few of the many NRCS programs through which to encourage greater utilization of alfalfa to capture these important environmental benefits.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>I applaud your effort to gather public comment on this important issue and strongly encourage you to work in partnership with alfalfa farmers and alfalfa organizations to develop programs capitalizing on alfalfa’s unique environmental benefits as you implement programs under IRA to fund the deployment of climate-smart practices.<br/><br/>",,,

IRS-2023-0066-21585,"Comment from Mosher, Moya","Thank you for issuing this strong guidance that recognizes the real impacts of producing hydrogen and clarifies which hydrogen projects will be eligible for the 45V tax credit established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The draft guidance avoids wasting billions of tax dollars on subsidies for dirty hydrogen production projects that would spike climate and health-harming pollution.  <br/><br/>Hydrogen produced by fossil fuels is never a climate solution and tax credits should only go to hydrogen projects that are truly clean. Clean hydrogen production must meet three key requirements: Electrolysis must be powered by clean electricity that is 1) drawn from newly built carbon-free sources, 2) physically deliverable to the electrolysis facility, and 3) matched hourly with the electrolyzer’s power consumption. <br/><br/>The Biden administration must account for the full harms of producing hydrogen from methane, but its current modeling assumptions undercount climate pollution from the methane gas industry.

The science is clear: Migratory monarch populations are facing extinction. Safeguards are urgently needed to rebuild monarch numbers because these once-common butterflies have drastically declined and now need our help to survive. <br/><br/>Protection for these beloved butterflies is warranted because of growing threats from climate change, logging of their winter habitat in Mexico and California, pesticides, ongoing loss of milkweed and wildflowers to sprawl development, and disease.  <br/><br/>Monarch protections should include safeguards from pesticides, especially insecticides that are particularly harmful to pollinators. The Endangered Species Act listing should protect monarchs from commercial sale because mass-reared monarchs threaten the health of wild populations.

NOAA-NMFS-2009-0029-6030,"Comment from Nathan Quade, Center for Biological Diversity","I am writing to urge the National Marine Fisheries Service to immediately enforce the Marine Mammal Protection Act Section 101 by banning swordfish imports until exporting countries demonstrate that their swordfish catch meets U.S. standards for protecting marine mammals.  This 36-year-old law protects dozens of species of dolphins, porpoises, sea lions, whales, and other species I care about while safeguarding U.S. fishers from unfair competition with unregulated foreign fishing fleets.  The time is long overdue to enforce the law and ban swordfish imports.<br/><br/>Congress recognized that fishing posed a threat to marine mammal species when it passed this provision of the Marine Mammal Protection Act over 30 years ago.  Enforcement of Marine Mammal Protection Act provisions for U.S. fisheries has led to the establishment of significant protective measures aimed at restricting harmful fishing practices and protecting marine mammal populations from unsustainable fisheries bycatch.  Congress also recognized that, if the United States' efforts to protect marine mammals from fisheries bycatch were to be successful, it would have to exert pressure on fisheries of other nations to adopt similarly protective measures.<br/><br/>The Marine Mammal Protection Act requires that all fisheries meet a ""zero mortality rate goal"" - in other words, that they reduce incidental death and serious injury of marine mammals to as close to zero as possible. This requirement has led to a number of important regulations on U.S. fishing, including gear-based requirements such as the use of pingers and net extenders, limits on the length of longlines, and as other measures like time-area closures, safe handling and release training and equipment, and mandatory observer coverage. All of these measures play a vital role in reducing fisheries' impact on populations of marine mammals and other species.<br/><br/>Banning swordfish imports until source countries demonstrate that they meet these important standards would use U.S. market power to protect marine species I care about around the world and protect the economic interests of domestic fisheries.

Building on the historic progress of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, this rule proposes limiting added sugars in school meals for the very first time. School meals that are limited in added sugars and sodium and contain whole grains can help introduce healthy eating habits and can help mitigate chronic health conditions.  <br/><br/>Added Sugars: School breakfasts are far too sugary, and I applaud the USDA’s proposed cap of no more than 10 percent of calories from added sugars, which mirrors the Dietary Guidelines recommendation. I also support USDA’s product-specific added sugars limits.   <br/><br/>Sodium: While these sodium reduction goals represent progress, the final limits do not go far enough and are out of alignment with the Dietary Guidelines’ quantitative recommendations. For instance, children up to age 8 will get 83 percent of their daily recommended sodium limit from breakfast and lunch combined, leaving just 17 percent leftover for snacks and dinner. A 13-year-old will get 77 percent of their daily limit from school breakfast and lunch, and high school students will get 63 percent.  <br/><br/>Whole Grains: The two options proposed by the USDA require less than half of grains offered be whole, which is not aligned with the Dietary Guidelines’ recommendations. I encourage the USDA to strengthen the whole grain-rich requirement. <br/><br/>Healthy, wholesome meals provide children the nutrients they need to grow, develop and learn in and out of the classroom, and the 30 million kids who rely on school meals every day deserve better.
