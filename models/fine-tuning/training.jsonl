However, <br/>the costs and burdens of this proposal go too far, too fast \u2013 we need to see a reasoned, <br/>rational approach that creates benefits that outweigh the burdens on the CPA preparer <br/>community and ultimately the tax-paying public.<br/><br/>CPA firms stand behind the work done by the CPAs and employees of their firms.  Requiring <br/>PTINs on tax returns should give the IRS enough information to track and weed out <br/>incompetent preparers, WITHOUT the need to require PTINs for non-signing preparers who <br/>work at CPA firms.  CPAs are already regulated by state boards of accountancy and <br/>Treasury Department Circular 230, so I believe strongly that the PTIN requirement should not <br/>be extended to non-signing preparers at CPA firms.<br/><br/>I also feel strongly that the exam component should be delayed until evidence is gathered <br/>that proves the need for such an exam. The goal is to raise competency and ethical conduct; <br/>therefore, the PTIN tracking proposal should be given time to do just that, before layering on <br/>potentially unnecessary and redundant regulatory burdens on CPA firms in particular, and on <br/>all preparers and the public.  In addition, I have concerns about certain aspects of the <br/>proposed Circular 230 rules that were recently released. <br/><br/>I request that the IRS:  (1) exempt CPA firms from the non-signing preparer requirements of <br/>the proposed regulations, and (2) delay the implementation of the exam requirement until the <br/>PTIN process is fully implemented and results are known.  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of my thoughts on these important issues.<br/><br/>David Goldman<br/><br/>An Independent Member of the BDO Seidman Alliance<br/><br/> Goldman Kurland and Mohidin LLP<br/><br/>Certified Public Accountants and Advisors<br/><br/>16133 Ventura Blvd.<br/><br/>Suite 880<br/><br/>Encino, CA 91436<br/><br/> <br/><br/>818-784-9000<br/><br/>818-784-9010 (fax)<br/><br/>www.gkmllp.com<br/><br/>\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "None|||1|||1"}]}

Public health has needs for ongoing support to establish and to maintain clinical care connections that manifest the nations health surveillance infrastructure. CMS and ONC have, to this point, focused principally on federal laws and on goals for patients and providers. But many of the benefits of health IT accrue in support of population health outcomes. And many of these public and population health activities are state and not federal responsibilities. <br/>- Electronic data are now the sine qua non for health information exchange and the federal agencies need to ensure that state and local laws are now fully supported electronically. To point, information blocking regulations should specifically identify failures to electronically support state laws like those that require the reporting of specific conditions. These state laws should not be menu choices for providers or optional implementations for EHR vendors. Specific language should be included in this new regulation that indicates that the failure to support state mandated reporting can be considered information blocking and subject to information blocking penalties.<br/>- Some public health programs benefited from Meaningful Use and some, to a much lesser degree, from Promoting Interoperability. However, many of these public health programs are still incompletely implemented and, resultantly, do not fully manifest opportunities to reduce provider burden from the automation of activities they seek to implement. In fact, legally mandated public health reporting was even cited in ONCs provider burden strategy. The programs for automating reporting need to be sufficiently supported in this regulation so that state laws are automatically addressed, and manual reporting is not otherwise considered a burden.<br/>- While state law-driven activities are not fully considered by these regulations, the definitions included in this NPRM are broad enough that public health agencies and systems could actually be construed as being in-scope for the penalties of these regulations as perpetuating information blocking themselves. We strongly suggest that public health organizations and their activities related to interoperability be clearly excluded from consideration of blocking information.<br/>- With the importance of public health surveillance, the failure of a certified product to support state laws and report to public health should not only be information blocking but should also be justification for suspension or termination of product certification. This is an issue of public health and safety as noted on page 316.<br/>- Public health programs need reliable and ongoing inducements for clinical care to initiate and maintain electronic connections. The menu choices of Promoting Interoperability have greatly reduced the inducements to initiate connections and there are few ongoing drivers to re-connect when clinical care system changes inevitably happen. EHR upgrades should not mean that legally mandated reporting stops.<br/>ONC is proposing to permit EHR health IT developers to use new versions of standards once these new versions are identified by the ONC. Many standards, however, involve data exchange between more than one organization. Without both sides of an exchange being able to operationalize a new standard, this suggested approach will be problematic.<br/>- EHR vendors should not implement new versions of interoperability standards that public health agencies are not yet prepared to support.<br/>- A more collaborative process that involves all the participants in determination of when a new standard is ready for implementation across organizational boundaries needs to be developed.<br/>ONC is seeking exceptions to the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) requirement to use voluntary consensus-based standards in several areas including the USCDI, the API Resource Collection in Health (ARCH), application programming interfaces (APIs) from consortia (like Argonaut), and more.<br/>- We do not support NTTAA exceptions for the identified activities and instead ask that the involved programs increase their support for inclusive, consensus-based standards activities that involve broad representation of industry participants - including public health. <br/>- In the past several years there has been an erosion of the consensus-based standards process with the advent of activities like some of those for which this regulation seeks exceptions (e.g. Argonaut, USCDI). Many of these activities do not have, or even allow, public health participation. Despite the lack of involvement, these processes can lead to HIT standards and infrastructure that non-participants, like public health, must then use.<br/> <br/>\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: American Immunization Registry Association \nAssociation of Public Health Laboratories\nAssociation of State and Territorial Health Officials \nCouncil of State and Territorial Epidemiologists \nInternational Society for Disease Surveillance \nNational Association of County and City Health Officials\n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "American Immunization Registry Association;Association of Public Health Laboratories;Association of State and Territorial Health Officials;Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists;International Society for Disease Surveillance;National Association of County and City Health Officials|||0|||1"}]}

These changes would drastically weaken the interagency consultation provision of the Endangered Species Act -- widely considered the most important and effective provision of the Act -- and also undercut the Endangered Species Act's proper role in addressing the impacts of climate change on our nation's most imperiled wildlife. <br/><br/>For 35 years the Endangered Species Act has protected imperiled species from the effects of potentially harmful federal projects. The strength of the Endangered Species Act has been the checks and balances created by interagency consultation between federal agencies that build roads, issue logging permits, and lease oil and gas rights among other projects, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and National Marine Fisheries Services, whose primary responsibility is the conservation of endangered species. <br/><br/>Interagency consultation ensures that federal projects that may impact America's most imperiled wildlife are independently reviewed by federal wildlife experts and project modifications are made where necessary. In the overwhelming majority of consultations federal projects move forward with little or no significant changes.<br/><br/>The regulations you recently proposed would eliminate interagency consultation on thousands of federal projects that pose a risk to endangered and threatened species each year. The changes will almost certainly result in detrimental impacts on endangered and imperiled species and a higher propensity to overlook opportunities to avoid such impacts.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the fact that these are the most significant changes to regulations implementing the Endangered Species Act in more than 20 years, you have provided the public just 30 days in which to submit comments, not the traditional 90, and prevented anyone from sending their comments by email. <br/><br/>I request you set an additional 60 days to allow the public an opportunity to meaningfully comment on these proposed regulations.<br/><br/>I also urge you to not to finalize these regulatory changes. <br/><br/>Thank you.\n- Organization: Center for Biological Diversity\n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Center for Biological Diversity|||1|||0"}]}

(Regeneron) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the CY 2022 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS)/Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) proposed rule.   Regeneron is a leading U.S. biotechnology company that invents life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.  Regeneron is committed to consistently and repeatedly bringing new medicines to patients with serious diseases.  Founded and led for more than 30 years by physician-scientists dedicated to fostering a science-driven, patient-centered mission, Regeneron has developed a unique ability to translate science into medicine consistently which has led to seven FDA-approved treatments and over 20 product candidates in clinical development across multiple therapeutic areas, all of which were homegrown in our laboratories.  Our medicines and pipeline are designed to help patients with conditions such as eye disease, heart disease, allergic and inflammatory diseases, pain, cancer, infectious diseases and rare diseases. Regeneron is accelerating and improving the traditional drug development process through its proprietary VelociSuite technologies and ambitious initiatives such as the Regeneron Genetics Center, one of the largest genetics sequencing efforts in the world.  As a testament to these capabilities, we have a robust partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to develop life-saving treatments, including a therapy authorized by the FDA under Emergency Use Authorization for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections.  As a company that has been listed for five consecutive years in Forbes Most Innovative Companies and listed on the Best Places to Work List, we are passionate about our home-grown science and the patients we serve.<br/><br/>For more than 30 years, Regeneron\u2019s goal has been to harness the power of science to bring new medicines to patients repeatedly.  We have fostered and maintained a long-term focus on bringing innovation to patients by investing our resources back into research and development of new technologies and therapies.  Regeneron also has priced our products responsibly and ethically. Regeneron routinely devotes over 30 percent of our revenue into research and development, and we continue to invest in scientific advances that have fueled innovative solutions to critical health challenges and problems, including the current COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>Our comments focus on CMS\u2019s proposal to provide separate payment in CY 2022 for the device category, drugs, and biologicals with transitional pass-through payment status expiring between December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022.  Among other products, we manufacture Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc), which is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody indicated for Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Libtayo received pass-through payment status under OPPS, effective April 1, 2019 and currently scheduled to expire on March 31, 2022.<br/><br/>As a result of CMS\u2019s proposal to use CY 2019 claims data, rather than CY 2020 claims data, to inform CY 2022 rate setting, CMS is proposing to use its equitable adjustment authority under 1833(t)(2)(E) to provide up to four quarters of separate payment for 27 drugs and biologicals, including Libtayo, and one device category whose pass-through payment status will expire between December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022.  CMS explained its rationale for this policy by stating that it is proposing for 2022 rate setting to use CY 2019 claims data in establishing the CY 2022 OPPS rates and to use cost report data from the same set of cost reports originally used in the final rule for 2021 OPPS rate setting.   CMS explains as follows in the OPPS proposed rule:<br/><br/>[D]ue to the effects of the COVID\u201319 PHE, we are proposing to generally use CY 2019 claims data instead of CY 2020 claims data in establishing the CY 2022 OPPS rates and to use cost report data from the same set of cost reports originally used in CY 2021 final rule OPPS ratesetting. If our proposal to use CY 2019 data, rather than CY 2020 data, to inform CY 2022 ratesetting, is finalized, we would effectively remove approximately one year of pass-through data collection time for ratesetting purposes. <br/><br/>We agree with CMS\u2019s proposal and its above-stated rationale.  This extension of pass-through status for the products listed in table 33 of the OPPS/ASC proposed rule  will support the intent of pass-through status by allowing for adoption of these new treatments and additional data collection.  We appreciate CMS\u2019s attention to this important payment policy in the context of the pandemic. <br/><br/>We greatly appreciate CMS\u2019s ongoing efforts on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries to ensure access to innovative therapies.  Thank you for considering our comments and please do not hesitate to ask us any further questions.\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|||0|||1"}]}

NPS is a private counseling practice that serves all ages of both genders who may have ADHD, struggling with executive functioning at work and at home in Illinois and surrounding states. Myself, and my colleagues believe the classification of CPT Codes 96130-96133 as valuable via telehealth only during the Public Health Emergency (PHE), and their failure to add them to the Medicaid Telehealth List (via Category 1) with permanency will negatively impact the patients I serve.The benefit seen by my patients through the use of neuropsychological testing via telehealth includes: <br/>\u2022<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The ability to safely monitor and objectively measure medication efficacy for Schedule II drugs to treat ADHD and related disorders.<br/>\u2022<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The Ability to remove arbitrary geographic restrictions on where patients must be located to receive services. <br/>\u2022<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The use of neuropsychological testing for medication management has been cleared by the FDA, and provides physicians a safe and validated way to monitor medication efficacy remotely.<br/>\u2022<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>In addition to improved safety measures, it also allows more consistent adherence to HEDIS guidelines for ADHD medication management. <br/>An additional benefit to classification of CPT codes 96130-96133 as Category 1 is physicians improved ability to close the disparity gap between rural and urban communities who are largely affected by neuropsychological disorders. With over 60% of rural Americans living in areas with a shortage of mental health professionals and over 65% of those who do receive mental health care obtain these services from a primary care provider, the need for access to appropriate and specialized mental health services via telehealth is clear.  Additionally, following the PHE there will continue to be a medically fragile population requiring these services for proper evaluation and treatment who would otherwise be underserved. <br/>Failure to support the ability to provide neuropsychological testing services via telehealth through recategorization to Category 1, will also limit necessary innovation in the field to serve a vulnerable population, where untreated psychological disorders can have public health safety risks alongside personal disenfranchisement. <br/>I am requesting the Center For Medicaid Services add CPT Codes 96136-96138 to the Medicaid Telehealth List with permanency.

The previous administrations expansion of the definition of sex in section 1557 of the ACA to include the termination of pregnancy could have tragic repercussions on health care professionals if it were ever implemented. I am glad that this proposed rule will clarify that sex should be defined by its ordinary meaning.<br/><br/>The proposed regulations clarify that Section 1557 does not require health care professionals or entities to cover abortions by resorting the plain meaning of the word sex and enforcing existing conscience protections laws. Without this clarification from HHS, that sex discrimination does not include the termination of pregnancy, the 2016 regulations could be read to require the provision of, and coverage abortion. If interpreted in this way, the availability of federal financial assistance could be conditional on acts that devalue the sanctity of human life. HHS does not have a compelling interest in requiring the provision and coverage of abortion, especially when Congress, has repeatedly protected decisions not to provide or cover abortion.  <br/><br/>The right to exclude abortion coverage from health plans, and the right of health care providers not to provide or refer for abortion, is protected under federal law. It is good for HHS to propose further regulatory provisions to ensure that existing conscience protections are enforced in relation to section 1557. Section 1303 of the ACA as well as the Church, Coats-Snow, Weldon, Hyde and Helms Amendments protect the conscience of health care providers. Further enforcement of these existing conscience provisions as well as a plain interpretation of discrimination on the basis of sex are vital to clearing up any confusion over whether section 1557 can be interpreted to require the performance or coverage of abortion.<br/><br/>Additionally, this change is consistent with the rest of the Trump Administrations policies when it comes to protecting the conscience rights in regards to performing or promoting abortion. On May 21, 2019 the Trump Administration published a final rule to ensure compliance with over 25 current statutes that explicitly protect individuals and entities from being forced to promote or perform abortions. By clarifying that sex is not defined to include termination of pregnancy, this proposed rule brings section 1557 of the ACA into compliance with existing federal policy, that it is not necessary for health care providers to pay for or perform abortions.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr. Daniel Brulinski\n- Organization: Family Research Council\n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Family Research Council|||1|||0"}]}

Bush and President Barack Obama for the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and other threatened marine national monuments.  Papahanaumokuakea represents our long-standing tradition of ocean conservation. The U.S. has been a world leader through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Standing by these designations is vital for America's economic and national security for these reasons:  - Protecting the environment is critical for global livelihoods and well-being. Globally, 1 billion people rely on seafood for essential nutrition -- yet 30 percent of the world's fisheries are overexploited or depleted.  - Marine conservation is good for our economic security. Papahanaumokuakea has significantly contributed to Hawaii's economy, having contributed an estimated $100 million to the Hawaii's economy in its first 10 years alone.  - Conservation of the marine environment is a value that is deeply rooted in Pacific cultures and traditions. Oceans have deep cultural and spiritual meaning for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  - Papahanaumokuakea is a living laboratory for scientific research, providing critical locations for comparison and study. Its extensive coral reefs are home to more than 7,000 marine species, including the threatened green turtle and endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Scaling back protections would needlessly undermine America's leadership in the region and around the globe. For these reasons, I encourage you to maintain and strengthen these marine national monuments.\n- Organization: Conservation International\n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Conservation International|||1|||0"}]}

It<br/>will prevent women with serious pre-existing medical conditions from<br/>getting the abortion coverage they need to protect their health, even<br/>when they pay for such coverage themselves. Pregnancy could lead to<br/>serious health threats for the medically vulnerable women who are<br/>otherwise uninsurable and need access to these plans.

The previous administrations expansion of the definition of sex in this section to include gender identity could have tragic repercussions if it were ever implemented.  I am glad to see you clarifying that sex should be defined by its ordinary meaning.<br/><br/>Though it supports the ideology of gender identity, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) understands the binary nature of sex and the need for the distinction. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) the APA defines sex as the Biological indication of male and female (understood in the context of reproductive capacity), such as sex chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, and nonambiguous internal and external genitalia.<br/><br/>If doctors and scientists treated patients without considering their biological makeup patient outcomes would suffer. Just recently, a woman lost her baby because she presented to the hospital as male and her symptoms werent properly diagnosed.<br/><br/>Additionally, this change is consistent with the rest of the Trump Administration and Congressional interpretation.  In October of 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a memo to all United States Attorneys and heads of department components regarding employment sex discrimination cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  This memo states that \"Sex is ordinarily defined to mean biologically male or female. . . . . Congress has confirmed this ordinary meaning [] in several other statutes[.] Congress has repeatedly declined to enact legislation to include gender identity in the definition of sex in various areas of nondiscrimination law and any such change should be the prerogative of Congress, not the agencies.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Judith Newman\n- Organization: Family Research Council\n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Family Research Council|||1|||0"}]}

The previous administrations expansion of the definition of sex in section 1557 of the ACA to include the termination of pregnancy could have tragic repercussions on health care professionals if it were ever implemented. I am glad that this proposed rule will clarify that sex should be defined by its ordinary meaning.<br/><br/>The proposed regulations clarify that Section 1557 does not require health care professionals or entities to cover abortions by resorting the plain meaning of the word sex and enforcing existing conscience protections laws. Without this clarification from HHS, that sex discrimination does not include the termination of pregnancy, the 2016 regulations could be read to require the provision of, and coverage abortion. If interpreted in this way, the availability of federal financial assistance could be conditional on acts that devalue the sanctity of human life. HHS does not have a compelling interest in requiring the provision and coverage of abortion, especially when Congress, has repeatedly protected decisions not to provide or cover abortion.  <br/><br/>The right to exclude abortion coverage from health plans, and the right of health care providers not to provide or refer for abortion, is protected under federal law. It is good for HHS to propose further regulatory provisions to ensure that existing conscience protections are enforced in relation to section 1557. Section 1303 of the ACA as well as the Church, Coats-Snow, Weldon, Hyde and Helms Amendments protect the conscience of health care providers. Further enforcement of these existing conscience provisions as well as a plain interpretation of discrimination on the basis of sex are vital to clearing up any confusion over whether section 1557 can be interpreted to require the performance or coverage of abortion.<br/><br/>Additionally, this change is consistent with the rest of the Trump Administrations policies when it comes to protecting the conscience rights in regards to performing or promoting abortion. On May 21, 2019 the Trump Administration published a final rule to ensure compliance with over 25 current statutes that explicitly protect individuals and entities from being forced to promote or perform abortions. By clarifying that sex is not defined to include termination of pregnancy, this proposed rule brings section 1557 of the ACA into compliance with existing federal policy, that it is not necessary for health care providers to pay for or perform abortions.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mr. Ron Butler\n- Organization: Family Research Council\n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Family Research Council|||1|||0"}]}

This is an obvious attempt to close the door of Planned Parenthood and other health care providers that,in addition to providing Title X services, also provide abortions. Title X patients are of lower income, and the majority are minorities.  For many patients, there is no other facility available to assume these services if these facilities close. Their patients will likely be unable to receive sny family planning services, resulting in more unwanted pregnancies and, yes, more abortions. In addition, opening Title X to organizations limited to counseling abstinence or other very unreliable birth control methods such as the rhythm method is a waste of my tax dollars and certainly not a service that Title X patients want.  They typically want, and certainly deserve, the ability and the privacy to select from the full-spectrum of FDA-approved family planning methods that are available to other women.\n- Organization: Advocates for Women\n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Advocates for Women|||1|||0"}]}

Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, Inc. is pleased to offer comments relative to the above docket number.  The National Heritage Corridor was established by Congress to preserve and protect the cultural treasures and natural landscapes of the Blackstone River Valley \u2013 Birthplace of America\u2019s Industrial Revolution.  Among our priorities is to improve the quality of the Blackstone River (Massachusetts and Rhode Island) with the goal of developing a fishable/swimmable river.<br/><br/>Consequently, we request that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers repeal the Navigable Waters Rule (Rule) as swiftly as possible to keep our nation\u2019s most vulnerable waterways out of harm. <br/><br/>As it stands, the Rule jeopardizes the health and safety of our streams, rivers, wetlands, and consequently our communities. Repealing the Rule quickly before the end of the year will reduce the risk of pollution to those waterbodies while the EPA creates a new, more protective Rule. Our groundwater resources, wetlands, and ephemeral streams provide essential ecosystem services and must be protected in the interim. <br/><br/>Waterways of New England, water does not respect political boundaries; it is interconnected. The Merrimack River flows for over sixty miles in New Hampshire before crossing into Massachusetts, and the Taunton, Blackstone, and Ten Mile Rivers all originate in Massachusetts but end in Rhode Island\u2019s Narragansett Bay. Similarly, the state\u2019s largest river, the Connecticut, enters Massachusetts from Vermont and New Hampshire, and continues into Connecticut. The interstate nature of our waterways necessitates strong federal protections that ensure no state suffers poor water quality due to another\u2019s policy shortcomings. Disparate state approaches make states downstream of more lax states vulnerable to reduced drinking water protection and weakened flood control. <br/><br/>Massachusetts is also home to four Wild & Scenic River systems. It is crucial that the small streams and tributaries in the headwater regions of these watersheds remain protected to ensure that these nationally significant rivers continue to thrive, especially amidst a changing climate and growing development pressures. <br/><br/>Rivers and streams are a key part of our state\u2019s recreation economy. In 2019, outdoor recreation supported 113,794 jobs and $5.5 billion in wages and salaries.  Fish and wildlife populations only thrive with the clean, cool flows provided by healthy wetlands and headwater streams. The Rule protects these resources that provide recreational opportunities for residents, and the employment opportunities for those who steward our waterways and open spaces. This is especially important as the pandemic continues in the United States, as people recreate closer to home in smaller streams and parks. <br/><br/>Although far less arid than the West, Massachusetts still experiences severe drought, and our rivers, drinking water supply, agricultural industry, and ecosystems have suffered as a result. We need to ensure our drinking water supplies are protected, as climate change brings more frequent and more severe droughts to our region. Allowing the existing Rule to prevail imperils access to secure, safe, clean water for families and businesses <br/><br/>We ask that the EPA repeal the Rule as quickly as possible, and we ask the Army Corps to support this policy to ensure robust protection of the country\u2019s water resources. <br/><br/>Thank you for considering our comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>RICHARD T. MOORE, Board Chair<br/>Blackstone Heritage Corridor, Inc.<br/><br/>670 Linwood Avenue<br/>Whitinsville, Massachusetts 01588<br/>\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Blackstone Valley National Heritage Corridor, Inc.|||0|||1"}]}

Walruses that are forced to haul out on land<br/>have a harder time finding food and are more vulnerable to disturbances<br/>that could lead to stampeding and trampling mortalities.<br/><br/>The recently-released U.S. Geological Survey study shows a 40% chance<br/>that walrus will be on a pathway to extinction by the end of this<br/>century. As scary as those odds are, they are likely far too optimistic<br/>because the study relied on  modeling that underestimates greenhouse<br/>gas emissions, global warming and rates of Arctic sea-ice loss.<br/><br/>The report also dismissed as negligible the impacts from reduced food<br/>supply for the walrus. Sea-ice loss in the Bering Sea is already<br/>leading to declines in the walrus's bottom-dwelling prey; ocean<br/>acidification is making Arctic waters increasingly corrosive and<br/>potentially lethal to the clams and mussels it eats. Still, the USGS<br/>determined that these threats have negligible influences on the<br/>walrus's future. The study would have found a significantly worse<br/>outlook for  walruses if it had used more realistic assessments of<br/>these threats.<br/><br/>The Pacific walrus needs the full protections of the Endangered Species<br/>Act to survive into the coming century. Please list the Pacific walrus<br/>under the Endangered Species Act, designate critical habitat, and<br/>design and implement a recovery plan as soon as possible.\n- Organization: Greenpeace\n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Greenpeace|||1|||0"}]}

Additionally, a significant percentage of all cigars may be considered to have a characterizing flavor.  This is true for premium cigars, and even more so for popular priced cigars, where as much as 50% of the category may be considered to have a characterizing flavor.  Thus, the FDAs proposed rule will fall particularly hard on those users who choose to enjoy popular-priced cigars.  Adult consumers like me are entirely capable of making our own decisions regarding the legal products we choose to use.<br/> <br/>I urge the FDA to reconsider this ill-advised effort to eliminate adult choices.\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "None|||1|||0"}]}

However, if you insist on doing so please be so kind to allow future cbo locations to be established indefinitely.  As an ama club member, we fly safely and away from other people. Requiring our planes to be connected to the internet and have a unique ID is overly restrictive.  Some of us have many many more planes, many of which we build from scratch.  What happens if our club moves?  Would we never be able to fly without this equipment going forward?  What happens if people want to establish a new club?<br/><br/>Additionally, the 400ft range is very unreasonable for larger models that have a slower rate of turn.  These are not the drones with 4 blades pointing upward that can turn on a dime.

The PWFA is aimed at assisting pregnant mothers who remain in the workforce by choice or necessity as they bring their child to term and recover after childbirth. The decision to disregard the legislative process to inject a political abortion agenda is illegal and deeply concerning.

The Trump Administration\u2019s attempt to shrink the poverty line by changing how it is adjusted for inflation is cruel and irresponsible. Changing the poverty line would mean millions of people could be denied help with essential medical treatment, prescription drugs, food, and home heating or cooling assistance, or see reductions in that help. Low-income people see their costs go up more than most people, so shrinking the poverty line will simply define them as non-poor and deny them the help they badly need. The Trump Administration should make a good-faith effort to find accurate measures of poverty and to understand the impact of the changes they propose on children, working people, retirees, women, people with disabilities, and communities of color instead of trying to redefine poverty out of existence. <br/><br/>If the administration implements this shrinkage of the poverty line, rather than treating people humanely, the members of the administration will have shown themselves to be uncaring, selfish, and ultra-manipulative.<br/><br/>Flora Greig <br/>greigs@andrews.edu <br/>2054 E Lemon Creek Rd <br/>Berrien Springs, Michigan 49103<br/><br/> <br/>\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "None|||1|||0"}]}

We need to do everything in our power to protect these animals and prevent another Unusual Mortality Event from occurring. <br/><br/>Revising the critical habitat designation is a long-overdue change that will increase their chances of survival and protect ecologically important areas to the maximum extent possible, given what we know and can anticipate about environmental changes \u2014 especially in light of the recent devastation brought by hurricanes Helene and Milton.<br/><br/>Having these designations is an important step in protecting manatees and ensuring their survival.

The changes are long overdue and will help ensure that construction workers earn fair pay and benefits for the hard work they do on federal construction projects. The proposed update will ensure that Davis-Bacon prevailing rates reflect actual wages paid to workers by restoring the three-step method for determining the prevailing wage.<br/><br/>The proposed stronger enforcement measures, including the anti-retaliation provisions, are historic and will ensure that workers who raise concerns about payment practices to DOL in investigations are protected from termination or other adverse employment actions.<br/><br/>Construction workers will also be in a better position to collect back wages owed due to wage violations by the contractor. The DOL would be empowered to withhold funds from both the same contractor and now related legal entities.<br/><br/>I urge the US Department of Labor to act quickly to finalize the proposed rule to ensure that construction workers on federally assisted projects are protected when they speak out on labor violations and can collect back wages to which they are entitled.\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "None|||1|||0"}]}

I am heartened by many aspects of your proposed restoration. <br/><br/>However, there are multiple aspects of your proposed rules that are insufficient for the challenges that endangered wildlife are facing.  <br/><br/>First, you must go back to the drawing board and fully restore section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, which governs interagency consultation. For 50 years it's been established that the federal government should not engage in activities that could jeopardize species' survival or destroy habitat they need to survive and recover.  <br/><br/>Specifically, the Biden administration must rescind the addition of \u201cas a whole\u201d to section 402.02. This Trump-era language created an enormous loophole, inconsistent with the intent of the Endangered Species Act itself. The nefarious \u201cas a whole\u201d language is a free pass to destroy critical habitat as long as the total destruction of a species\u2019 entire critical habitat is avoided. This is especially damaging for wide-ranging and migratory species, from piping plover to marbled murrelet, from salmon to lynx. This language also ignores the cumulative impact of different causes of habitat destruction over time. And it goes against the science-based establishment of critical habitat to ensure both the species survival and recovery, instead treating some areas of critical habitat as expendable.   <br/><br/>Additional definition changes from the Trump era that need to be reversed include one that creates unnecessary confusion when examining an agency action that is ongoing, or a continuation of past activities as opposed to something new (\u201cenvironmental baseline\u201d section 402.02).   <br/><br/>Additionally, you must reverse Trump\u2019s damaging changes in section 424.11(e) that allow plants and animals to be prematurely delisted. It is essential that species recovery meets all science-based standards before removing the backstop of Endangered Species Act protections that have kept so many species alive.  <br/><br/>Each of the many changes to Endangered Species Act regulations made by the Trump administration weakened protections for threatened and endangered species at a time when we must be doing everything in our power to fight the biodiversity crisis and recover species from the brink of extinction. Despite the broad support for restoring and strengthening the rules that implement the Act, you\u2019ve left multiple loopholes from the Trump-era rollbacks in place, which will undoubtedly jeopardize future efforts to protect wildlife and habitat. By failing to fully restore the Endangered Species Act rules, you've left a significant job less than half done. Now is the time to get this right; we have no more time to waste.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Enoe Corado<br/>PO Box 410056  San Francisco, CA 94141-0056\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "None|||1|||0"}]}

Not only is    this crucial for preserving ancient forests in Alaska, but also for    ensuring the future of the Roadless Rule itself, which has helped    protect the last remnants of fish and wildlife habitat on 58 million    acres of national forests throughout the United States.    With its old-growth forests effectively capturing and storing carbon    dioxide from the atmosphere, the Tongass is one of the America's most    important carbon sinks and a critical tool in the fight against climate    change. Scientists have estimated that this national forest itself    accounts for about 8 percent of the carbon sequestered by all national    forests. Protecting the Tongass from old-growth logging will not only    preserve that capacity, but avoid releasing carbon currently stored in    its trees.    The Tongass is also the ancestral and contemporary homeland of the    Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian peoples, and they have been the driving    force in the effort to protect the forest. Their way of life is    inextricably linked with these lands and waters. They hunt, gather,    fish, and harvest medicines in the Tongass, which their ancestors have    stewarded for more than 10,000 years. Restoring full Roadless Rule    protections is aligned with the position taken by Tribes in Southeast    Alaska and will allow their traditional use of the land to continue.    As part of planning for a future beyond large-scale old-growth logging,    please also make a sustained federal financial investment in the    Southeast Alaska Sustainability Strategy. Operating in full    consultation with Tribal governments and local communities, this    program will invest in Tribal priorities and will help to stoke the    already robust fishing and recreation industries that are currently    driving the region's economy.    Thank you for your time.    Sincerely,    Jeffrey Barile    -PII-\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "None|||1|||0"}]}

This rule was one of the only safety regulations implemented in the aftermath of the most devastating oil spill disaster in our nation?s history. Dismantling safety measures like the Well Control Rule while the administration simultaneously seeks a radical expansion of offshore drilling in nearly all federal waters is simply unacceptable. <br/><br/>In 2010, BP?s Deepwater Horizon rig exploded following an exploratory well blowout, which killed 11 crew members and gushed over 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The oil spill continued for 87 days as engineers tried and failed to seal the blowout. Six years later, the Well Control Rule was established to help prevent another BP-like disaster. There are far too few safety standards in place for dirty and dangerous offshore drilling and actively weakening existing safeguards is unimaginable. Weakening this rule would prioritize the profits of oil and gas companies over the safety of our environment and coastal communities. We cannot afford another offshore drilling tragedy.<br/><br/>I strongly oppose this reckless rollback of safety standards for offshore drilling. The administration is putting our marine life and healthy oceans at unnecessary risk by revising a measure that did not go far enough to begin with. I urge you to reject this proposal that would make offshore drilling even more dangerous ? we need much more safety, not less.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Robert Martin III\n- Organization: NA\n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "None|||1|||0"}]}

NEPA and its implementing procedures provide a strong foundation for informed, science-based decisionmaking.<br/><br/>NEPA is also an essential tool in the fight against environmental racism. NEPA promotes environmental justice by requiring federal agencies to include study and disclosure of a proposed project's potential environmental, economic, and public health impacts on low-income, minority, and rural communities. It also provides opportunities for meaningful input from those affected communities.<br/><br/>I urge the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to abandon this rulemaking process altogether. I also oppose any other changes to NEPA's implementing procedures that would in any way restrict public input, limit consideration of project alternatives, establish hard deadlines for project approval, or narrow or eliminate federal agencies' obligations to consider a project's climate impacts.<br/><br/>NEPA is democracy in action - it is one of the only laws that allows the public to provide input in decisions that affect the health and safety of their communities.

PHMSA must act quickly to finalize comprehensive standards for gas pipelines.<br/><br/>Important elements of this proposal include requiring more frequent leak surveys, faster leak repair times, use of more advanced technologies and equipment for detecting leaks, minimizing intentional venting and blowdowns and increasing the quality and availability of data available to the public.<br/><br/>PHMSA should improve the proposal in the following ways. First, operators should be required to find and fix leaks on all gas-gathering pipelines. Right now, there are hundreds of thousands of gathering pipelines that are not subject to minimum maintenance requirements, presenting an environmental and safety risk. The proposal would address some but not all of these pipelines  PHMSA should close this gap and require operators to manage leaks on all gathering lines. <br/><br/>Second, PHMSA should set clear and rigorous definitions for leak detection technology performance, to ensure that operators have clarity regarding which equipment satisfies the advanced methane detection standard that will maximize leak identification. The proposal provides broad discretion to operators in implementing leak detection and repair programs, which could result in confusion and suboptimal outcomes. <br/><br/>Third, PHMSA should adopt clear and strong well integrity standards that include standards for infrastructure and monitoring to prevent leaks as well as leak detection and repair standards for the nations 400 underground natural gas storage facilities and associated pipeline infrastructure.<br/><br/>Finally, I ask that PHMSA not provide an exemption for soon-to-be-replaced pipes. Older pipes are known for leaking more, but the proposal would allow operators to ignore identified gas leaks for as long as five years if the pipe segment is scheduled for replacement. To ensure safety and reduce harmful methane emissions, operators should be required to address known leaks even if the pipeline will eventually be replaced.   <br/><br/>Another piece that could be improved is expanding information reported by pipeline operators. With more data and transparency, we can better mitigate the harm by current pipelines and we can set out a better plan for future actions.<br/><br/>We should seize this opportunity to support cost-effective and common-sense standards that protect both our communities and our climate.

Self awareness helps you become aware of the rest of the world and makes you wonder how can I help. It did me any way.<br/><br/>My way is to pass it forward. These wonderful authors are passing 'it' forward. The message is every thing is energy. Our bodies are like a battery. They operate on negative and positive impulses. Love and knowledge makes your body generate a healing energy. Hate and Fear creates a negative energy and your body creates disease. <br/><br/>There is a place for Conventional and Integrative medicine and it should be more like Universal Medicine where a common since understanding that what you put in your body determines your longevity and quality of life. <br/><br/>Insurance Coverage should include Complementary and Alternative Medicine choices. Prescription medicine is not the only answer to your body healing.

A Federal and State Registered Union Apprenticeship gave me the professional craftsmanship skills to earn a good living wage with health and retirement benefits. <br/><br/>I work with other union members, who received the same great Union Registered Apprenticeship training as I did. This means we perform efficient, high quality work and keep each other safe on the job-site by avoiding unnecessary accidents and injuries. <br/><br/>Thanks to our Insulators Union Registered Apprenticeship Program, I earn good wages and excellent health and retirement benefits, which allow me to support my family financially.<br/><br/>Our Heat & Frost Insulators and Allied Workers signatory contractors often bid on projects that require a workforce trained to the industry's highest standards. In an Insulators Union Registered Apprenticeship Program, just like the one I completed, we receive the best training and education. Through a combination of mandatory classroom education and on-the-job training, Insulator Union apprentices develop elite skills. Thanks to our state-of-the-art training centers, where our apprentices receive industry leading training, including OSHA safety classes, we produce highly trained and highly skilled mechanical insulators. As someone who successfully completed the Insulators Union Registered Apprenticeship Program, I can work anywhere in the country in order to support my family. Our training is so important, that my union Brothers and Sisters are proud to say that part of our hourly wages supports our training programs. No taxpayer dollars are used to train union insulators. Do not change a system that has worked for more than 115 years. I fully support keeping IRAPs out of the construction industry indefinitely.<br/><br/>For more than 115 years, the Heat and Frost Insulators Union has successfully provided skills and safety training through the its Union Registered Apprenticeship Program. Allowing contractors to make their own training rules would devastate the construction industry, create dangerous situations on jobsites and harm an industry struggling to find enough men and women to perform the work. <br/><br/>With this petition, I believe there is a strong need to continue the mandated oversight and regulations from Federal and State governments on ALL construction industry Apprenticeship Programs.  <br/><br/>Chris Labit,<br/>Mechanical Insulator, Insulators Union<br/>42 years of service\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "None|||1|||1"}]}

This requires us to exercise critical thinking daily, not only as part of a larger health care delivery team but also individually when deciding how best to provide care based on each patient\u2019s particular needs. <br/><br/>Radiologic technologists are similar in a broad sense to a variety of other health care workers who are required to exercise critical thinking and independent judgment as part of their daily jobs. The job of the radiologic technologist involves operating imaging equipment to capture images of a patient\u2019s internal body structures and troubleshooting systems to ensure diagnostic-quality images. They collaborate with radiologists, ensuring that diagnostic-quality images are captured through the appropriate imaging modality. For example, a technologist must use certain imaging techniques for a trauma patient to assure safe imaging and accurate diagnosis.  Capturing elbow images that allow for diagnosis on a patient who walks in is quite different than capturing images for a patient with significant trauma. Radiologic technologists work autonomously to use their knowledge, tools and critical thinking skills to capture diagnostic images. If images are not diagnostic, the radiologist may miss a diagnosis. Radiologic technologists must enforce strict radiation protocols throughout their work, and they have a critical role in patient care: providing instructions to patients and ensuring patients are comfortable and safe during procedures.   <br/><br/>The role of the radiologic technologist in the modern health care industry continues to evolve as the demand for improved imaging technology accelerates. This has made radiologic technologists more essential and has required more specialization. Therefore, I believe it appropriate that the SOC occupational definition for radiologic technologists be reconsidered to more accurately reflect the increasingly professional responsibilities of this occupation. Additionally, technologists\u2019 therapy counterparts, radiation therapists, are already classified as professionals, and they ensure a similar level of patient management and critical thinking as radiologic technologists every day. <br/><br/>I urge the OMB to take this opportunity to revise the SOC occupational definitions to provide important updates to the radiologic technologist definition that reflect the growing importance of the profession. I urge the OMB to update definition to more clearly designates the radiologic technologist as a professional. This would more accurately reflect the actual practice of this vital health care role and ensure that this profession is properly characterized. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to present these comments for the OMB\u2019s possible revision of the SOC for 2028.\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "None|||1|||1"}]}

I strongly oppose this rule and request that it be rescinded because it discriminates against organizations that believe in the biological definition of \u201csex\u201d and ultimately leads to harmful reduction in services to American families.<br/><br/>Organizations that receive HHS grants provide invaluable services to so many families in need. Those organizations that receive federal funding through HHS grants should not be forced to accept an expanded definition of \u201csex\u201d that includes \u201csexual orientation and gender identity\u201d and could ultimately lead to life-altering actions, including promoting gender transitions of minors.<br/><br/>While there is some action taken in the rule to assist faith-based organizations, some individuals and organizations will have serious concerns with, for instance, using their services intended for a woman be provided to a biological male, despite their being no faith basis for their reasoning. It is completely logical that an organization helping women overcome violence would wish to continue to deter men from using women\u2019s restrooms. <br/><br/>State legislatures too are working hard to protect youth from being cornered into believing they should undergo \u201ctransition\u201d procedures. Many states have already adopted legislation prohibiting the harmful practices of so-called \u201cgender affirming care,\u201d including mastectomies on healthy, young women. This rule sidesteps those state legislatures by forcing states to embrace this new definition of \u201csex\u201d when accepting this block grant funding. <br/><br/>States, non-profits, and organizations seeking to serve the public and protect our nation\u2019s young people should not be excluded from federal funding for their beliefs about human sexuality.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of this comment. I again would like to see this rule completely rescinded.\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Output:\nRespond with a single line of output formatted following the guidelines above:\n<ORGANIZATION>|||<INDIVIDUAL>|||<EXPERT>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "None|||1|||0"}]}
