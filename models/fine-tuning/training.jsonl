This 36-year-old law protects dozens of species of dolphins, porpoises, sea lions, whales, and other species I care about while safeguarding U.S. fishers from unfair competition with unregulated foreign fishing fleets.  The time is long overdue to enforce the law and ban swordfish imports.<br/><br/>Congress recognized that fishing posed a threat to marine mammal species when it passed this provision of the Marine Mammal Protection Act over 30 years ago.  Enforcement of Marine Mammal Protection Act provisions for U.S. fisheries has led to the establishment of significant protective measures aimed at restricting harmful fishing practices and protecting marine mammal populations from unsustainable fisheries bycatch.  Congress also recognized that, if the United States' efforts to protect marine mammals from fisheries bycatch were to be successful, it would have to exert pressure on fisheries of other nations to adopt similarly protective measures.<br/><br/>The Marine Mammal Protection Act requires that all fisheries meet a \"zero mortality rate goal\" - in other words, that they reduce incidental death and serious injury of marine mammals to as close to zero as possible. This requirement has led to a number of important regulations on U.S. fishing, including gear-based requirements such as the use of pingers and net extenders, limits on the length of longlines, and as other measures like time-area closures, safe handling and release training and equipment, and mandatory observer coverage. All of these measures play a vital role in reducing fisheries' impact on populations of marine mammals and other species.<br/><br/>Banning swordfish imports until source countries demonstrate that they meet these important standards would use U.S. market power to protect marine species I care about around the world and protect the economic interests of domestic fisheries. Therefore, I strongly urge the National Marine Fisheries Service to implement the ban immediately.

General Todd Semonite,<br/><br/>On behalf of the Massachusetts Rivers Alliance, I wish to express our strong opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers' (Corps) proposal to repeal the 2015 Clean Water Rule. This Rule was carefully developed to protect our nation's waters and a repeal of this Rule would jeopardize the health and safety of our streams, rivers and wetlands. <br/><br/>The Clean Water Rule is a strong, commonsense policy that clarifies the authority of the Clean Water Act by creating a clear regulatory framework. If the Rule is repealed, at least fifty-two percent of Massachusetts' stream miles and millions of acres of wetlands nationwide will be at risk from pollution and development. Massachusetts is proud of its three federally designated Wild and Scenic Rivers, whose health would be threatened if their tributaries and neighboring wetlands become polluted. Seventy-three percent of Massachusetts residents rely on drinking water sources fed by small streams that are protected by the Clean Water Rule. Blocking this rule would imperil drinking water sources, as well as the communities and businesses that rely on clean water.<br/><br/>The economic benefits of the Clean Water Rule are extensive. The original 2015 EPA estimates for the Rule indicated that it would provide between $339 million and $572 million annually in benefits to the public. The documented economic benefits of wetland and stream protections include reducing flooding, filtering pollution, providing wildlife habitat, supporting hunting and fishing, and recharging groundwater. The elimination of all wetlands economic benefits from the new 2017 EPA cost-benefit analysis is illogical and misrepresents the value of these ecosystems. <br/><br/>In addition to providing key ecosystem services, small streams and wetlands also support crucial native species and are key to Massachusetts's vibrant recreational industry. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reports that in 2011, $2.0 billion was spent on wildlife recreation in MA, including $455 million on fishing alone. Healthy wetlands and headwater streams provide the clean, cool flows and essential habitat for our fish and wildlife populations. It is critical that we continue to protect these waterbodies with an inclusive definition of the Clean Water Rule. <br/><br/>States will be adversely affected by a repeal of the Clean Water Rule. By eliminating federal jurisdictions from wetlands and streams and allowing disparate state approaches, states downstream of more lax states will have reduced drinking water protection and flood control. Water does not begin and end at state lines and leaving this authority to the states will put us on a race to the bottom for water protection.<br/><br/>The Clean Water Act has a bold goal - to make all of our waterbodies fishable and swimmable. Repealing the Clean Water Rule will make it far more difficult to achieve this goal. Please listen to the majority of Americans who expect the EPA to protect clean water, not polluter profits. To repeal the Clean Water Rule now would be shortsighted and fly in the face of public opinion. We ask that the EPA keep the existing Rule and we ask the Army Corps to support this policy, to ensure robust protection of the country's water resources. <br/><br/>Thank you for considering our concerns.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Julia Blatt, Executive Director<br/>Massachusetts Rivers Alliance<br/>14 Beacon Street, Suite 607<br/>Boston, MA 02108\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Instructions:\n1.

The current lack of transparency exploits motor carriers, inflates consumer costs, and compromises highway safety.<br/><br/>Transparency Protects Safety and Reduces Exploitation<br/>Opaque broker practices harm carriers, forcing them to cut costs to stay operational. This often leads to deferred truck maintenance, longer work hours, and driver fatigue\u2014direct threats to highway safety. Additionally, brokers frequently take excessive margins by charging shippers far more than they pay carriers. For example, brokers charge shippers $50 per hour for detention time but compensate carriers only $35 per hour\u2014and only after a four-hour delay. Such practices increase costs for consumers while unfairly exploiting truckers.<br/><br/>Immediate Transparency is Essential<br/>The proposed 48-hour delay in record disclosure allows brokers to manipulate and withhold critical information. Transparency should occur immediately upon delivery acceptance, empowering carriers to resolve disputes and negotiate fair rates. Other broker-based industries, such as real estate, disclose fees upfront; the freight industry must meet the same standard.<br/><br/>Shippers Must Pay Carriers Directly<br/>The current system, where brokers act as payment intermediaries, creates unnecessary complications. Brokers often subcontract loads to other brokers, further obscuring payments and eroding carrier earnings. Direct shipper-to-carrier payments would eliminate these issues, ensuring timely and fair compensation while reducing administrative inefficiencies. Legal precedent, including Exel, Inc. v. Southern Refrigerated Transport, Inc. (807 F.3d 140, 6th Cir. 2015), affirms that shippers are ultimately responsible for paying carriers, supporting this reform.<br/><br/>Ban Waivers of Transparency Rights<br/>Brokers routinely require carriers to waive their rights under \u00a7371.3, undermining transparency. These waivers should be explicitly prohibited, and brokers must comply with transparency requirements regardless of contract terms.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>The FMCSA must address these critical issues to ensure fairness, safety, and efficiency in brokered freight transactions. I recommend:<br/><br/>Immediate disclosure of transaction records upon delivery acceptance.<br/>Upfront fee transparency for broker margins.<br/>Prohibiting multi-broker subcontracting without disclosure.<br/>Direct payments from shippers to carriers.<br/>Explicitly banning waivers of \u00a7371.3 rights.<br/>These changes will protect carriers, reduce costs for consumers, and promote safety.

Relocation within the region is not favorable due to excessive poaching, loss of habitat, and significant drought conditions.  If not relocated, these magnificent creatures will be culled. Each partner zoo has the resources to provide the elephants with wonderful new homes, proper nutrition and excellent veterinary care.  In addition, the ongoing support for Swazilands in-situ rhino conservation program by the partner zoos will contribute to the survival of the rhinos.

The previous administrations expansion of the definition of sex in this section to include gender identity could have tragic repercussions if it were ever implemented.  I am glad to see you clarifying that sex should be defined by its ordinary meaning.<br/><br/>Though it supports the ideology of gender identity, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) understands the binary nature of sex and the need for the distinction. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) the APA defines sex as the Biological indication of male and female (understood in the context of reproductive capacity), such as sex chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, and nonambiguous internal and external genitalia.<br/><br/>If doctors and scientists treated patients without considering their biological makeup patient outcomes would suffer. Just recently, a woman lost her baby because she presented to the hospital as male and her symptoms werent properly diagnosed.<br/><br/>Additionally, this change is consistent with the rest of the Trump Administration and Congressional interpretation.  In October of 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a memo to all United States Attorneys and heads of department components regarding employment sex discrimination cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  This memo states that \"Sex is ordinarily defined to mean biologically male or female. . . . . Congress has confirmed this ordinary meaning [] in several other statutes[.] Congress has repeatedly declined to enact legislation to include gender identity in the definition of sex in various areas of nondiscrimination law and any such change should be the prerogative of Congress, not the agencies.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Belinda Kangombe\n- Organization: Family Research Council\n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Instructions:\n1.

I am opposed to the Agency's flawed policy that a bachelor's degree in nursing is equivalent to a bachelor's degree in the biological sciences, as well as its proposal to list nursing \"as a separate qualifying degree...for purposes of meeting the educational requirements for moderate and high complexity testing personnel and technical consultants.\"<br/><br/>A bachelor's degree in nursing is NOT equivalent to a biological sciences degree, and it does not provide academic instruction sufficient to perform or supervise non-waived laboratory testing. A biological sciences degree may require 60 semester hours or more of biological and chemical sciences-much of it upper level-whereas a nursing degree typically requires fewer than 15 semester hours of biological and or chemical science-most of which tends to be introductory/survey level. As a degree, it is insufficient to provide the necessary scientific knowledge and training in non-waived laboratory procedures. <br/><br/>Unless a bachelor's degree is substantially equivalent in terms of its course load and level and related laboratory training/experience, it should not allow its holder to perform high complexity testing or supervise non-waived laboratory testing. While I am aware of workforce shortages in the laboratory, these should not be solved by employing individuals from another health care discipline that has its own shortage situation.

The current five-year offshore leasing program does not allow for new lease sales in the Beaufort Sea. Preparing for a new lease sale at this point is premature and indicates that BOEM has pre-determined the outcome of planning process it is currently undertaking for 2019?2024?even though a new program is still in its initial stages.<br/> <br/>There is no compelling reason to rush to sell leases in the Beaufort Sea. In recent years, oil companies have walked away from investments there. Moreover, drilling in these waters could cause enormous damage. A major oil spill could have severe consequences and would be all but impossible to clean up. Even routine oil and gas operations create noise, air and water pollution, and they generate air and vessel traffic that can have serious consequences.<br/> <br/>If BOEM continues to consider a 2019 Beaufort Sea lease sale, it should exclude offshore areas with particularly important biological or cultural importance. These areas include the Barrow Canyon area, the region between Oliktok Point and Demarcation Bay, Smith Bay, the Harrison Bay?Colville Delta region, and the Beaufort shelf break.

This is why I strongly urge the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure that the requirement of physician involvement in the anesthesia care of Medicare patients is reinstated.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE), CMS issued a temporary waiver of the Medicare requirement of physician anesthesiologists in anesthesia care to prepare for potential shortages of physician providers.  Unfortunately, this was done without substantial justification; the pandemic does not necessitate this policy change because the existing supervision rule already provides for flexibility, deferring to state Governors to opt-out of the requirement if necessary. There have been no demonstrated shortages of anesthesia providers, and states have rescinded early waivers noting that the elimination of physician involvement related to anesthesia care serves no purpose. Further, replacing physician anesthesiologist-led care does not create any cost savings nurse anesthetists and physician anesthesiologists bill Medicare the same amount.<br/><br/>As the public health emergency continues, physicians and all providers on the front lines know that the Medicare waiver is unnecessary.  We have seen that COVID-19 has reinforced the need for team-based anesthesia and critical care services as their expertise and training is critical to the care of COVID-positive patients.  Covid-19 can cause serious lung and breathing problems in patients of all ages; one of the key roles of an anesthesiologist during surgery is to maintain a patient's breathing.  Older patients infected with COVID-19 are some of the most complex and challenging cases a physician will see in their career.  Now is not the time to take the physician away from patients.<br/><br/>Any attempt to permanently remove physician involvement in anesthesia care is dangerous and lowers the standard of care. Many Medicare patients have conditions that put them at higher risk during surgery. While the nurse-only model of care may be appropriate for other health care settings such as primary care, it is not a safe approach for Medicare beneficiaries in the acute, critical, and perioperative care settings, where life-threatening situations occur unpredictably. It is these instances where a physician's significant training and education is required for accurate diagnosis and successful intervention. When seconds count, you want a medical doctor leading a patient's care, not a nurse.<br/><br/>Medicare patients deserve to have access to the highest quality, team-based model of anesthesia care to ensure their safety. I urge you preserve the current Medicare anesthesia safety standard.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/>Dr. Venkat R.

I am proud of the work we do every day to make sure menthol cigarettes and other tobacco products are sold only to adults 21 and older.  Please do not move forward with this unfair proposal that could harm tobacco retailers across the United States by shifting many of these products to illegal sellers that don't care who they sell to or how they do it.<br/><br/>If implemented, this proposal could hurt retailers and wholesalers in the U.S. and directly impact my bottom line.  This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue; menthol cigarettes alone make up 36% of all cigarette sales in the United States.   Additionally, adult customers who purchase menthol cigarettes also purchase gas, food, and other items that my store depends on.<br/><br/>It makes no sense to end the sale of these products through licensed retail stores like mine.  Bans could shift sales to illegal markets where many consumers can still get them, but without any regulatory protection or underage prevention. Flavor bans create illegal markets that could endanger the public with bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access, crime, arrests, and community conflict.<br/><br/>Underage use of menthol cigarettes is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21 -- not with bans that create illegal markets.  Responsible, licensed retailers like me have worked hard to comply with age-verification requirements, and these efforts are a big reason why underage rates have fallen so low.<br/><br/>I respectfully urge you to reconsider a ban on menthol cigarettes, and instead focus on more positive solutions that respect the role of responsible, legal businesses like mine.  Instead of banning products for adults, the government should be giving adult smokers more information and choices for lower risk tobacco products -- as well as continuing to focus on underage prevention and education.<br/>\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Instructions:\n1.

Please do not move forward with this rule that could harm my business by shifting a large part of my sales to illegal, unregulated markets.<br/><br/>Our company adds to the local economy. Banning flavored cigars could have a direct and negative impact on our sales, threatening jobs and the economic contributions our business provides.  With inflation and gas prices so high, regulators should not compound the economic hardship convenience store operators are facing by removing their ability to sell flavored tobacco products.  <br/><br/>This ban targets a significant portion of my revenue, since flavored cigars alone generate $4 to $5 billion in annual retail sales and make up 37% to 47% of popular price large cigars sold in the United States. This proposal to ban the legal, regulated sale of flavored cigars could undermine my ability to operate by impacting my revenue. <br/><br/>Further, this ban could harm retailers and businesses across the country by pushing many sales away from legal businesses like mine.  Instead of being sold in stores that follow the law, sales of flavored cigars could move into illegal markets where any sale and distribution would be treated as a crime in many states.    Flavor bans create illegal markets that sell unregulated bootleg products, cause massive tobacco tax revenue losses, and lead to more underage access and crime.<br/><br/>Underage use of flavored cigars is down to less than 1%, a historic low.  These reductions have happened not by prohibiting product choices for adults, but with education, underage prevention, and, most recently, a national minimum age of 21.<br/><br/>Please consider the possible harm to small businesses and our communities this ban could cause.  Instead of banning legal products for adults, FDA should focus on solutions that work, like education, cessation support, underage prevention, and authorizing less harmful alternatives for all adult smokers.  <br/>\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Instructions:\n1.

We are calling on you to urgently create a strong, lasting national rule that protects mature and old-growth trees and forests across federal lands from the threat of logging. Protecting and recovering these natural climate solutions would be a crucial piece of U.S. climate policy.  <br/><br/>Safeguarding and expanding carbon-rich forests on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands is one of the most important, cost-effective, and timely approaches to fighting the climate crisis. Mature trees store and continue to absorb large amounts of carbon in addition to providing the public with clean drinking water, habitat for imperiled wildlife, and world-class recreational opportunities. Larger, older trees are also far more fire resistant, and a well-constructed rule would not preclude necessary, science-based efforts to address the risk of fire.   <br/><br/>Unfortunately, vital mature forests and trees on federal lands are currently threatened by numerous proposed and ongoing logging projects, in spite of President Biden\u2019s executive order to conserve them. We need to ensure America's mature and old-growth trees and forests remain in place to mitigate climate change, and to maintain their natural benefits for future generations.

These changes represented the most significant rollbacks to the Endangered Species Act in the law\u2019s 50-year history and pushed hundreds of species closer to the brink of extinction.  <br/> <br/>It is extremely disappointing that this proposed rule retains a number of harmful provisions governing the responsibility of federal agencies to avoid jeopardizing protected species or adversely modifying their critical habitat. In particular, it retains a definition of \u201cadverse modification\u201d that requires federal actions to affect species\u2019 critical habitat \u201cas a whole\u201d before real habitat protections are put in place. This is especially harmful for species like the northern spotted owl, polar bear or gulf sturgeon that have large critical habitat designations but are still at risk of extinction. The provision ignores the basic fact that the single largest driver of extinction here and around the world is habitat loss and allows the Services to turn a blind eye to the vast majority of actions that harm critical habitat.  <br/> <br/>The proposed rule also retains the Trump-era definition of \u201cenvironmental baseline,\u201d which lets federal agencies off the hook for past harms to endangered species from things like dam or highway construction by deeming these projects part of the baseline. It absolves the agencies of much responsibility for the damage caused by interrelated actions they facilitate, such as urban growth from highway expansion or increased global warming from emissions related to federal oil and gas leasing.  <br/> <br/>The remaining Trump-era regulations that the agencies are proposing to retain \u2014 including the criteria for not prudent determinations for critical habitat \u2014 are equally problematic and will continue to put endangered species at greater risk of extinction. Thus, I urge the Services to rescind them in their entirety without exception. <br/> <br/>There are some aspects of the proposed rule that I support. I am grateful that the Biden administration plans to restore the \u201cblanket 4(d) rule,\u201d which will restore protections for threatened species. I also support reinserting the provision that prohibits consideration of economic impacts when deciding to protect species, as well as the provision that removes barriers to designate critical habitat for climate-impacted species.  <br/><br/>However, while the proposed rule restores some pieces of the Endangered Species Act regulations, it is wholly inadequate and represents a huge missed opportunity to make meaningful progress to recover our most vulnerable animals and plants on the 50th anniversary of the Act\u2019s passage.  <br/> <br/>With time running out, we can\u2019t afford more of the status quo. Combating the global wildlife extinction crisis will require the Services to be bolder and more visionary than any other administration in history. For these reasons, I urge the Services to not only rescind the Trump-era rollbacks in their entirety, but to also strengthen the implementation of the Endangered Species Act to avert the extinction crisis and curtail the ongoing loss of biodiversity in the United States and around the world.\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Instructions:\n1.

In reality, it doesn\u2019t appear the rule will achieve any such benefit. Since the rule requires that conservation leases must allow all ongoing activities to continue\u2014even if they are destructive uses like livestock grazing\u2014any benefit from restoration that might accrue from the lease would be seriously diminished.<br/><br/>\u2022 Wilderness areas should be exempt from the conservation leasing program. Leasing public lands for any purpose commodifies those lands\u2014since commercial enterprise is generally banned in Wilderness, leasing Wilderness for any purpose would likely violate the Wilderness Act.<br/><br/>\u2022 The conservation leases put a heavy emphasis on active intervention, manipulation, and restoration. Such heavy-handed management runs counter to the fundamental tenet of the Wilderness Act to let nature be, so the intended management of the leased lands poses a risk to Wilderness. This is yet another reason Wilderness areas should be off-limits for conservation leases.<br/><br/>\u2022 BLM should unequivocally state in the new rule that the overarching mandate for wilderness stewardship is to preserve each area\u2019s \"untrammeled\" or \"wild\" character.<br/><br/>\u2022 In lieu of conservation leases in Wilderness, there should be a mechanism for permanent retirement of grazing permits in Wilderness and other sensitive areas. At a minimum, there should also be a non-use status for 10 years of grazing allotments in Wilderness that do not meet land health standards. It would be preferable for the permits to be revoked until recovery occurs.\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Instructions:\n1.

Climate experts say that we must reduce our carbon emissions dramatically to avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis. The Federal Government has a unique ability to create market standards through its procurement process. It has a responsibility to make those standards as strong as possible. By making sure that federal purchasing dollars go to greener buildings and materials, lower- and zero-emission vehicles, and other more sustainable purchases, President Biden and his administration can provide a needed boost in the transition to a clean energy economy and incentivize the private sector to move in a more sustainable direction.<br/><br/>The 2018 National Climate Assessment found that the climate crisis could slash about a tenth of our economy by the end of the century. That economic contraction dwarfs any negative impact that strong climate procurement standards could have on an individual firm.<br/><br/>We must use every tool in the toolbox to fight the climate crisis.

For nearly four decades, NEPA\u2019s burdensome and overbearing regulations have held back American infrastructure and hurt union workers. <br/><br/>It\u2019s time for that to change. We must take advantage of the opportunity we have to modernize NEPA.

It will reduce delays and uncertainties and lower the overall risk for companies \u2014 resulting in more roads, bridges, and airports being built and more union jobs. <br/><br/>Modernizing NEPA would be a huge win for union workers and we must act now.

Also referred to as the Public Lands Rule, the Bureau of Land Management's interest in establishing parity for conservation with various other uses of our public lands is a critical move for achieving real balance in management.<br/><br/>Given that the BLM is the steward of our largest public lands estate, managing more than 245 million acres, the result of this rulemaking process would greatly benefit hunters and anglers who rely on healthy, intact landscapes to pursue fish and game. Valuing conservation of intact habitat - including migration corridors - on par with other uses provides an unparalleled opportunity for the BLM at a time when intense drought, severe wildfires and encroaching invasive species threaten our public lands.<br/><br/>As proposed, this rule would promote critical restoration work by utilizing conservation leasing, a new tool for BLM to manage healthy public lands and accommodate more novel mitigation approaches. Targeted conservation leasing could help restore degraded and fragmented landscapes, increasing their resilience and improving the connectivity of migratory corridors.<br/><br/>I want to thank the BLM for its commitment to improving the management of our public lands and waters through this proposed rule, which will improve the conservation of fish and wildlife habitat for the benefit of hunters and anglers.\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Instructions:\n1.

Bears Ears National Monument also provides incredible spaces for outdoor activities-- it is one of best places in the world for rock climbing and bouldering. These public lands need to stay in public hands. No president has EVER attempted to abolish a national monument, and an attack on one park is an attack on all our parks.

As noted in the proposed rule, steps like these to protect churches and other faith-based employers, ensuring they have a level playing field with others, are nothing new. The Civil Rights Act was signed into law by President Johnson in 1964 and, in Title VII, regarding employment, Congress provided important protections for religious employers. Congress even broadened these protections about a decade later.<br/><br/>President Johnson understood the need to ensure that faith-based employers had a level playing field of access to and competition for grants and took this into account in Executive Order (EO) 11246 on federal contracting.<br/><br/>When the DOL was tasked with enforcing EO 11246 in 1978 it included Title VIIs exemption for religious educational institutions in its implementing regulations. In 2002 President Bush amended the EO by including Title VIIs exemption for religious organizations, which has since also been implemented by DOLs regulations.<br/><br/>It wasnt until the Obama administration that protections for faith-based employers were curtailed. The Trump administration DOL is reinvigorating these protections to their former status in line with, not only historical precedent, but recent decisions from the Supreme Court. For example, inTrinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, a church that ran a daycare center was denied access to a government grant program for nonprofit organizations to make their playgrounds safer for children, simply because they were a church. The Supreme Court made clear that Trinity Lutheran Church had just as much right to participate in the grant program as any other daycare center; their status as a church did not prevent them from playing an equal role in the public square. With this rule, the Trump administration DOL is simply affirming a principle the Supreme Court held to be squarely in line with the First Amendment by a 7-2 vote.<br/><br/>Religious liberty is a vital cornerstone of our nation. It is imperative that it is closely guarded and upheld. I commend the DOL for doing just that with this rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mrs. Sheilah Marshall\n- Organization: Family Research Council\n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Instructions:\n1.

Typically only 30% of people answer surveys.  This number needs to be a percentage of discharges not an across the board number.<br/>2) Face to Face encounters:  This is a huge burdeon for the sickest clients, those that are truely bedbound and the obese.  We have a clients who weigh over 700 pounds, they cannot get out, they do not fit on an ambulance stretcher, I do not know how we will meet this, the MD's do not do home visits either.  The other group are those that are elderly, cognitively disabled and bedridden that cannot get to the MD office any other way than by ambulance-this adds burdeon and expense for them and their caregivers.  many of these are on service for foley catheter changes and are seen 2 or 3 times a certification period only.\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Instructions:\n1.

We should all be working to build a society that stands with moms in need. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act was a major, bipartisan achievement toward that goal\u2014an achievement made possible because Congress had the good sense to leave abortion out of it (as confirmed by senators who spoke on it at the time).<br/><br/>It is unconscionable that the EEOC is trying to corrupt this landmark law by interpreting it to require employers to grant accommodations for abortion, the complete opposite of supporting pregnancy, and not what Congress intended. I strongly urge the EEOC not to include abortion in its final regulations, and to enact a religious exemption that is more clear and robust than what is proposed and ensures that employers are not required to act contrary to their religious beliefs.<br/><br/>Democrats and Republicans were able to come together and do a good thing for pregnant women and their babies by passing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The EEOC should not sabotage their work by turning the law into an abortion-accommodating mandate.\n- Organization: \n- Government Agency: \n- Attachment: \n\n### Instructions:\n1.
